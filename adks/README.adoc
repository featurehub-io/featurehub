= Admin SDKs

The artifacts under this directory provide API for the Admin SDKs - the SDKS exclusively talk to the Management Repository,
or Admin App. The Management front end application uses a similar SDK.

They are purely generated from the OpenAPI documentation, so if the API formats don't suite your needs, there is 
likely to be one that is closer in format to what you require.

We have included these as examples, references (we will keep them up to date as the API changes), and they 
are used for testing our Client SDKs and Examples.

Because the code is generated, the generated code is not stored in this repository (unlike the Client SDKs). In
each case the code can be generated using Maven, with `mvn clean package`.
