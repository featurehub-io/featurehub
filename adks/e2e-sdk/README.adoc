The purpose of the SDK/ADK tests in this folder are to ensure that the more advanced use cases that are supported
by the FeatureHub SDK (such as strategies and attributes) are fully working as expected. 

What we are testing is the _flow_ - is data flowing properly from MR to Dacha to Edge - we are less interested in the 
behaviour of the SDK itself as that would require testing each SDK for the entire flow.
