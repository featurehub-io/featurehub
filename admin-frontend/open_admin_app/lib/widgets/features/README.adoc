= Structural Overview

This provides an overview of how the Flutter components fit together here.

This is created by the route manager, where the PerApplicationFeaturesBloc is the first created.

Important concepts:
- FeatureGrouping = a tab, representing a grouping of specific types of features (e.g. booleans, number/strings, json)

----
 PerApplicationFeaturesBloc - holds the server features for each featureGrouping and the application id
   |
 FeatureStatusRoute 
   |
 TabSelectedBloc - controls which featuregrouping is currently selected
   | 
 TabParentWidget
 |   |  |
 |   |  _FeatureTabsHeader - shows all possible tabs and when clicked on, tells the TabSelectedBloc to change
 |   |
 |   FeaturesOnThisTabTrackerBloc - holds the state of each tabs feature data
 |   |
 |   TabsView - holds the per tab features bloc and creates the FeaturesOverviewTableWidget
 |
 | HiddenEnvironments - allows control over hidden environments
----

Starting here again:

----
FeaturesOverviewTableWidget
  |
FeaturesOnThisTabTrackerBloc - tracks the full state of all features inside this 
  |
_FeatureTabsBodyHolder
  |
 Row of:
  - ... FeatureNamesLeftPanel (1 per feature)
  - EnvironmentsAndFeatureValuesListView - this is listing all of the features
----
