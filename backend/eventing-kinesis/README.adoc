= Kinesis Support in FeatureHub

== Local Development

Run the localstack with the default names configured usin

 $ ./testing-setup.sh

You can confirm it is working using:

 $ awslocal kinesis list-streams

Then you need to enable kinesis in the app, in each of the env vars you need to have:

----
cloudevents.kinesis.enabled=true
cloudevents.kinesis.endpointUrl=http://localhost:4566
aws.accessKeyId=testing
aws.secretAccessKey=testing
----

NOTE: your access key and secret don't matter for localstack.
