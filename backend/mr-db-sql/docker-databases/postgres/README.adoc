== postgres

This will automatcally create a postgres database for you with a featurehub database
mounted with a featurehub user with featurehub as the password.

This will allow you to set your `~/.featurehub/mr.properties` to

----
db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/featurehub
db.username=featurehub
db.password=featurehub
----

If you are running postgres outside of docker, you can install it (use `brew` on a Mac). Then log
in using the root user (`postgres` normally) and password. And then you can just use the same commands
as in the initdb.sh to create the user + database + grants as you like.

Ebean has the capability to have a separate DDL user to a database user
but we do not expose that functionality.
