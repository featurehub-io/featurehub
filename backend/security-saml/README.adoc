this allows FeatureHub to be an SP (ServiceProvider). It expects that the NamedID is configured to be an email
address and either the displayname is configured in Name Attribute `urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.241` or
the first name is `urn:oid:2.5.4.42` and last name is `urn:oid:2.5.4.4`. When you configure your SAML provider
you are generally able to configure extra attributes, you will need to enable FeatureHub to extract the person's name
so it can correctly create the user. Only the email and name is required.

To create your own config - your own certificate and your own private key, please use the following:

 $ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out certificate.crt

== notes

This is a FeatureHub layer that sits on top of work from https://github.com/onelogin/java-saml[Onelogin SAML]
