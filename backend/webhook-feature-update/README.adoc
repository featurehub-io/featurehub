== Webhook -> Features

This provides the ability for a listener of the enriched feature stream to send webhooks based on configuration
in individual Environments in FeatureHub MR.

It expects that:

- the webhook for features is enabled
- there is an endpoint
- there may be one or more headers, they are `,` separated, with `=` separating their key and value pairs. Both
sides of the kv pair must be url-encoded so they don't conflict with the `,` and `=`.

The listener will `POST` the event as a CloudEvent (hand coded until 2.5+ of the cloudevents library is released),
with appropriate custom headers. The results of the POST and any exception will cause a new event to be posted 
back to the MR so it can keep a record of events sent for a specific environment.
