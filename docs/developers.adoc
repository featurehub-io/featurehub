== Building from scratch

These instructions are for advanced engineers who want to run their own instance of FeatureHub.

If you don't need to customise or enhance FeatureHub, we recommend using the prebuilt Docker images for running FeatureHub.

=== Build Instructions

This project requires you to have Java 11 as your primary Java and Maven 3.5 or later installed.

- Java 11 should be downloaded from https://adoptopenjdk.net/ (do not download it from Oracle)

==== Java 11 on Mac OS X

This downloads as a gziped tar file, extract the folder and move it to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` but ensure
you tack a `.jdk` on the end, so `jdk-11.0.2+9` becomes  `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2+9.jdk`.
Then set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to that folder + `/Contents/Home'.

We recommend using brew on Mac OS X to install Java. You can use any version 11+.

If you have downloaded it from AdoptOpenJDK (or used brew), then use this:
----
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home
----

If you have downloaded it from Oracle, use the following (or similar based on the version you have)
----
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2+9.jdk/Contents/Home
----

This will cause the installed 'java' to swap to that version.
Type `java -version` to confirm it has changed.

=== Building from the command line

Type `mvn clean install` and it should build everything, including the Docker ready
tar file (see below).

TIP: If you get an error like `--release` not known, you are using Java 8.

==== Technology stack

This application stack uses Java 11+.

Ensure you do a:

`mvn -f pom-first.xml clean install` before opening in IDE and before opening the main pom.xml file.

==== Just the APIs

If you just want to install the apis and ensure they are consistent, use:

`mvn -f pom-api.xml clean install`

=== Running NATS

----
docker run -d --name nats-main -p 4222:4222 -p 6222:6222 -p 8222:8222 nats:2.1.2-scratch
----

if you were running it and the container has shut down for some reason (machine reset for
example):

----
docker restart nats-main
----

Alternatively, you can simply download it for your O/S and run it. It takes up
less memory.
