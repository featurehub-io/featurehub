== Overview

https://www.featurehub.io/[FeatureHub] is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage their features, from feature flags (also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or centralised configuration.
It's an essential ingredient for enabling the feedback loop and feature testing and experimentation in production with real users (see diagram below).

Visit our official web page for more information about the platform https://www.featurehub.io/[here]

Building software with feature management encourages DevOps practices like
https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com[trunk based development], continuous delivery and importantly, separating deployment from release management.
Enabling teams to deliver value to customers early and often, whilst maintaining high quality and keeping risk low.

FeatureHub can be used with small startups through to large enterprises with many applications and teams.
It has an enterprise grade security and permission model, that's intuitive and easy to use, so you can be up and running quickly.

FeatureHub is a self-hosted platform so you can run it on your own infrastructure.

== Installation

There are link:installation{outfilesuffix}[3 main deployment options] for running FeatureHub. As FeatureHub is packaged as a _Cloud Native_ bundle, all parts are Docker images and are intended to be used with that technology (i.e. Docker or Kubernetes).

There is a GitHub https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install[repository] where you can find all the deployment options.

All of the deployment options mount the database volume separately from the main set of containers, allowing you to upgrade your database and versions of FeatureHub without destroying your database.

NOTE: FeatureHub runs on the following SQL Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle and we provide initialization and migration DDL for each of these databases.
Others can be supported, please contact us.

=== Starting small

If you are just curious to see how FeatureHub works and would like to play with it before deciding which of the 3 installation options are right for you, you can also try it just by running several commands and without cloning this repository.
You can watch the video with some instructions https://youtu.be/DRVqXJmbvTk[here] or follow the instructions below.

Start with running this simple line:

----
docker run -p 8085:80 -v ~/tmp/party:/db featurehub/party-server:latest
----

where `~/tmp` is where you wish to store the database (h2).
This will start FeatureHub Admin Console on port 8085 and you can now register as Super Admin, create Portfolio, Application, Feature etc.

Once you have done this, you can then simply run the example app that comes with this docker container, so you don't have to create sample app and add SDK code yourself.
The example project consists of a back-end service (node) and a front-end sample app (React) with some sample features already in place.

==== Running the example

The example will need to know the SDK URL of your environment (which you can find in the FeatureHub Admin Console), and it will need an IP address that the second docker can get access to.
If you know how to use docker networks, you should be able to find this easily, otherwise find your en0 ip address (you can type: `ifconfig en0` - choose the inet address, Windows will be slightly different) or similar, do not use localhost as that will not work.

----
export SDK_URL=default/d8ba747d-7d3c-4454-9c58-130390848412/5EE3vua1NqY0ez6Zd4TXU7XnsZdAPHtR96XaDmhfegitKGiQ9aCdmtmeNUNPubkRZLJLUUpaC7b05ELk
export MY_IP=192.168.XX.XX
docker run -e FEATUREHUB_APP_ENV_URL=http://$MY_IP:8085/features/$SDK_URL -p 5000:5000  featurehub/example_node:0.0.1
----

This will cause the example to start and you can access it on port 5000. Add a few todo's in mixed case.
If you create a feature flag in the FeatureHub Admin Console called `FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE`, unlock it and set it to true.
Now check your sample front-end app, you will see a "refresh" message appear.
If you refresh, it will upper case everything.
Experiment!This flag is affecting the backend service as this is where we implemented the feature using one of the SDKs.

Now in the FeatureHub Admin Console, if you create a feature value - a String value called `SUBMIT_COLOR_BUTTON` and set its value to (say) `cyan`, you will again see a refresh indicator in the sample front-end app and on refresh the "Add" button will swap to cyan colour.
Each time you change the colour, it will recommend you to refresh.
It is doing this because it is set in "catch and release" mode, and we recommend you read up on the SDKs for further information on this.

== Architecture

Please read link:architecture{outfilesuffix}[for information about the architecture of FeatureHub].

== Key concepts

=== Portfolios

Portfolios are simply a collection of one or more applications.
Typically, portfolios are named to match areas of your business where groups of applications (or application suites) live.
Once created these portfolios can be managed by "Portfolio admins".
There is no limit to the number of portfolios you can have.

image::images/fh_overview.svg[Overview,500]

==== Portfolio groups
You can create one or more groups of people, these groups can be used to set various permissions
on the applications and their environments, within the portfolio. Either use the same groups across applications within the
portfolio, or create separate groups for each application.
Some example groups might be:

* _Developers_ (Typically can create features and change feature values in non-production environments)
* _Testers_ (Typically can change feature values in non-production environments)
* _Operations_ (Typically can't create or delete features but can update values in production)

NOTE: Every Portfolio automatically gets a group called "Administrators", Simply adding people to this group will
make them administrators for this portfolio, and they can do anything in any application within that Portfolio.

=== Applications

Applications are where you create features and environments, they belong inside a portfolio.

=== Environments

Applications have one or more environments, these typically refer to groups of co-operating deployments of your
application in different environments. There are often multiple development environments, testing environments, 
acceptance testing and customer demo environments depending on the application. 

When an application is created there is always an initial environment 
called `Production` created. The values of your features are set, per environment. 

Every FeatureHub environment has a unique ID, this ID plus a Service Account is what you reference in your application via the 
SDK when you query for the value of the features.

=== Features

Features are the main part of FeatureHub, they can be simple feature flags, strings, numbers or more advanced JSON 
formats intended for forms of configuration.

==== Feature types

You can create features of the following types:

* `BOOLEAN` used for basic feature flags (toggles)
* `NUMBER` numerical values
* `STRING` string values
* `JSON` valid JSON only (typically used for remote configuration, or otherwise overriding internal values of an application)

NOTE: future support will exist for YAML and JSON-Schema to ensure valid configuration for JSON and YAML types.

==== Feature key

The feature key is the reference you use in your application, when you use the SDK,
you can check the value of a feature, referencing the feature key.
It *must be unique* for your application.

==== Feature value

When you add a feature flag, this will also automatically create a feature value in each environment. The default feature value will be set to `*off*` for `boolean` type and to `*null*` for `string`, `number` and `json`. By default, each feature value will be locked. Essentially feature value is always associated with an application and an environment for that application.  

NOTE: See <<Feature Permissions>> for details on the various permission states a feature can have.

=== Service Accounts

==== Server Evaluated API Keys
//TODO
If your client is insecure (such as a mobile
or browser based client), you should generally use a Server Evaluated API Key - because this means none of the strategies of your
API keys leak to the client - which can include user ids, email addresses, warehouse ids and so forth. These cannot realistically be used however
when you are doing server side software where every request can come from a different use with different details, they simply don't scale.

==== Client Evaluated API Keys
//TODO
If your client is secure (such as one of your own services, run in your Cloud) then you should use this key
and you can identify it because it has a `*` in it. It ensures all the features are able to be evaluated on the client side and thus
you can set a client context for each request and evaluate those keys within it.

== Rollout strategies and targeting rules

=== Rollout strategies

Rollout strategies provide an ability to rollout features to a limited audience based on targeting rules, for example imagine you have a feature flag of type string which controls a "submit button color" that can be in multiple states,
e.g green, blue, red etc. With rollout strategies, you can serve a `green` value to users on `iOS` devices,
`blue` value to users whose emails ending with `gmail.com` and `red` value to users whose location is
`New Zealand or United States or United Kingdom`. You can also use percentage based rollouts and for example, turn your feature "on" only to 50% of the audience.

Rollout strategies are created and added per <<Feature value>>. Once you add a strategy you will be able to set a feature value for this strategy, for example "on" or "off" value. A feature will always have "default value", which will be applied for any of your users that do not match rollout strategies rules. You can change the default strategy value at any time (given you have permissions). 

You can apply zero or more rollout strategies to a feature. Each rollout strategy can be assigned a different feature value.

=== Targeting rules
A rollout strategy consists of one or more rules. That rule can consist of any combination of matching criteria, so we refer to them
often as targeting rules. 

Each additional rule is always applied as an `AND` condition - the user is using a mobile device that is iOS `AND`
their country is Australia.

Each rule is essentially a key, a condition (equals, includes, etc) and zero or more values. Whereas each targeting rule
is an `AND` condition, each _value_ is an `OR` condition. For example, if the `country` is `New Zealand` `OR` `Indonesia`
`AND` the custom field `payment_method` is equal to `credit_card` `OR` `direct_debit`.

Each rollout strategy can have zero or more rules associated with it. If it has zero rules and no percentage rule 
the strategy will be ignored. There is no limit on how many rules you can apply. There are 3 main rule types: *Preset*, *Custom* and *Percentage split* 

=== Targeting rule types

==== Preset

- Country

Available https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-countries-1993160[list of countries to match on]

- Device

Available values to match on:
`browser, mobile, desktop, server, watch, embedded`

- Platform

Available values to match on:

`linux, windows, macos, android, ios`

- User Key

For example, can be used to match on email address, partial email address, user id, partial user id or regex.

- Version

Requires to be in semantic version format, e.g. `1.2.0` -  read more about semantic versioning https://semver.org/[here]

==== Custom

If you cannot find a suitable rule from those listed above, you can create your own rule. When setting up a custom rule you will be required to select a rule type.

*Supported custom rules types:*

`string` 

`number` - any valid number 

`boolean` - true and false

`semantic version` - as per semantic version format. If you are only targeting Java you also get the additional formats supported by Maven and Gradle.

`date` - international format only - ``YYYY-MM-DD ``

`date-time` - international format only - `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.NNN` with an optional timezone, UTC is assumed

`ip-address` - CIDR or specific IP addresses are supported.


If you do not set the value in the client context in the SDK, and the rule indicates to match `blank` value then this rule will evaluate to true.

=== Percentage split rule

As well as setting up targeting rules you can also setup percentage split rule. Percentage rules lets you rollout a feature value to an approximate percentage of your user base.

A typical scenario for a flag for example would be a "soft launch". The "default value" of your flag would be `off` and you set some arbitrary percentage
to `on` (e.g. 20%). Then you would analyse how your feature is performing for those 20%, collect any user feedback, monitor your logging for any issues and if you are happy you will start
increasing the rollout to more and more people in your user base, eventually setting it to 100%, changing the default to
"on" and removing the strategy. (This is set _per environment_).

As you can specify one or more split targeting strategies for a feature flag, in case of percentages, the sum of all of them cannot be over 100%.
A typical scenario for multiple strategies would be when you operate with non-binary Feature Flag (e.g. string). If you add percentage based rollout strategies that do not add to 100%, then the remainder continues to use the
default value.

You can also use percentage rules to perform *_A-B testing_* or *_run experiments_*, using the on/off of feature flags,
or feature values where you can set on numbers or strings. Given FeatureHub provides a GoogleAnalytics connector - you can see the result of your experimentation in the Google Analytics Events dashboard in real time.

Percentage rules can be mixed with other rules, for example a strategy can have a country rule and a percentage rule, e.g. turn on the feature flag to 25% of the audience in New Zealand.

Percentage rule is by default implemented against
a single field value provided by the client. By default this is `sessionId`, if that isn't provided `userKey` is used.
Otherwise you can provide your own field to base your percentage rollouts on.


NOTE: It is important to note that the percentages are an approximation, the algorithm works by taking contextual data you provide
in SDK in the client side (either a `sessionId` or a `userKey` or your own field, ideally consistent for the user across platforms) and it uses
an algorithm to spread that across a range giving you control down to four decimal points, but the algorithm is more accurate
the greater the number of clients you have. i.e. you can rollout to 0.0001% of your usage base if you wish.
If you only have five users, this probably won't turn it on for anyone, if you have a million it will
be more accurate.


== Security

=== Key Security concepts
==== Administrators
There are two types of administrators, *Site Administrators* and *Portfolio Administrators*.

===== Site Administrators
* *Site Administrators* can:
** Create and manage users of the system
** Create and manage portfolios

===== Portfolio Administrators
* *Portfolio Administrators* can:
** Create and manage portfolio groups
** Create applications
** Manage access to applications
** Create Service Accounts

NOTE: Every Portfolio automatically gets a group called "Administrators", Simply adding people to this group 
will make them administrators for this portfolio.

==== Service Accounts

Service accounts are used for programmatic access to the features for an application.
A service account will need a minimum of `READ` access to an environment in order to access a feature value.


==== Feature Permissions
For each application environment, there are permissions you can assign to portfolio groups or service accounts.

* `READ` Can see the value of a feature
* `LOCK` Can lock a feature, so it's value can't be changed, this gives us a
safety net when deploying incomplete code into production.
(Typically developers and testers keep features locked until they are finished and ready to be set)
* `UNLOCK` Can unlock a feature, so it's value can be changed
* `CHANGE_VALUE` Can change the value of a feature
 

NOTE: Groups can also separately be assigned the permission to create, edit and delete entire features.
