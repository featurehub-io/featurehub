== Overview

FeatureHub is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage and their features, from feature flags 
(also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or centralised configuration management.
It's an essential ingredient for enabling the feedback loop see diagram below).

Building software with feature management encourages DevOps practices like
https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com[trunk based development], continuous delivery and importantly, 
separating deployment from releasing. Enabling teams to deliver value to customers early and often, 
whilst maintaining high quality and keeping risk low.

FeatureHub can be used with small startups through to large enterprises with many applications and teams.
It's has an enterprise grade security and permission model, that's intuitive and easy to use, 
so you can be up and running quickly.

FeatureHub aims to have the greatest range of options available for the software community, from the ability to run
it self hosted, through to a SaaS platform, allowing you to start small and hosted, grow and self host, and then
deciding to outsource your continually growing feature management as you get more successful.

== Architecture

Please read link:architecture{outfilesuffix}[for information about the architecture of FeatureHub].

== Installation

There are 3 main deployment options for running FeatureHub. As FeatureHub is packaged as a _Cloud Native_
bundle, all parts are Docker images and are intended to be used with that technology (i.e. Docker or Kubernetes).

All sample configurations are in the `run-configurations` folder. All of the run configurations mount the
database volume separately from the main set of containers, allowing you to upgrade your database and
versions of FeatureHub without destroying your database.

NOTE: FeatureHub runs on the following SQL Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle and we provide
initialization and migration DDL for each of these databases. Others can be supported, please contact us.

=== Starting small

If you wish to get up and running without using `docker-compose` and downloading this repository, we would
recommend running this simple line:

----
docker run -p 8085:8085 -v ~/tmp:/db featurehub/party-server:0.0.4
----

where `~/tmp` is where you wish to store the database. This will start FeatureHub on port 8085 and you can now
create your first Superuser, Portfolio, Application, Feature etc.

Once you have done this, you can then simply run the example project and tie the two together.

=== Running the example

The example will need to know the SDK URL of your environment, and it will need an IP address that the second
docker can get access to. If you know how to use docker networks, you should be able to find this easily, otherwise
find your en0 ip address (you can type: `ifconfig en0` - choose the inet address, Windows will be slightly different)
or similar, do not use localhost as that will not work.

----
export SDK_URL=default/d8ba747d-7d3c-4454-9c58-130390848412/5EE3vua1NqY0ez6Zd4TXU7XnsZdAPHtR96XaDmhfegitKGiQ9aCdmtmeNUNPubkRZLJLUUpaC7b05ELk
export MY_IP=192.168.XX.XX
docker run -e FEATUREHUB_APP_ENV_URL=http://$MY_IP:8085/features/$SDK_URL -p 5000:5000  featurehub/example_node:0.0.1
----

This will cause the example to start and you can access it on port 5000. Add a few todo's in mixed case.
If you create a feature flag called `FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE`, unlock it and set it to true, you will see a "refresh"
message appear. If you refresh, it will upper case everything, experiment. This flag is affecting the backend.

If you create a feature value - a String value called `SUBMIT_COLOR_BUTTON` and set its value to (say) `cyan`, you will
again see a refresh indicator and on refresh the Add button will swap to Cyan. Each time you change the colour, it will
recommend you refresh. It is doing this because it is set in "catch and release" mode, and we recommend you read up on
the SDKs for further information on this.

== Key concepts
=== Portfolios
Portfolios are simply a collection of one or more applications.  Typically, portfolios are named to match areas of your
business where groups of applications (or application suites) live.  Once created these portfolios
can be managed autonomously (via <<_portfolio_administrators>>) from the rest of FeatureHub. There is no limit to
the number of portfolios you can have.

==== Portfolio groups
You can create one or more groups of people, these groups can be used to set various permissions
on the applications and their environments, within the portfolio.  Either use the same groups across applications within the
portfolio, or create separate groups for each application.
Some example groups might be:

* _Developers_ (Typically can create features and change feature values in non-production environments)
* _Testers_ (Typically can change feature values in non-production environments)
* _Operations_ (Typically can't create or delete features but can update values in production)

NOTE: Every Portfolio automatically gets a group called "Administrators", Simply adding people to this group will 
make them administrators for this portfolio, and they can do anything in any application within that Portfolio.

=== Applications

Applications are where you create features and environments, they belong inside a portfolio.

=== Environments

Applications have one or more environments, these typically refer to groups of co-operating deployments of your
application in different environments. There are often multiple development environments, testing environments, 
acceptance testing and customer demo environments depending on the application. 

When an application is created there is always an initial environment 
called `Production` created. The values of your features are set, per environment. 

Every FeatureHub environment has a unique ID, this ID plus a Service Account is what you reference in your application via the 
SDK when you query for the value of the features.

=== Features

Features are the main part of FeatureHub, they can be simple feature flags, strings, numbers or more advanced JSON 
formats intended for forms of configuration.

==== Feature types

You can create features of the following types:

* `BOOLEAN` used for basic feature flags (toggles)
* `NUMBER` numerical values
* `STRING` string values
* `JSON` valid JSON only (typically used for remote configuration, or otherwise overriding internal values of an application)

NOTE: future support will exist for YAML and JSON-Schema to ensure valid configuration for JSON and YAML types.

==== Feature key

The feature key is the reference you use in your application, when you use the SDK,
you can check the value of a feature, referencing the feature key.
It *must be unique* for your application.

NOTE: See <<Feature Permissions>> for details on the various states a feature can have.

== Security

=== Key Security concepts
==== Administrators
There are two types of administrators, *Site Administrators* and *Portfolio Administrators*.

===== Site Administrators
* *Site Administrators* can:
** Create and manage users of the system
** Create and manage portfolios

===== Portfolio Administrators
* *Portfolio Administrators* can:
** Create and manage portfolio groups
** Create applications
** Manage access to applications
** Create Service Accounts

NOTE: Every Portfolio automatically gets a group called "Administrators", Simply adding people to this group 
will make them administrators for this portfolio.

==== Service Accounts

Service accounts are used for programmatic access to the features for an application.
A service account will need a minimum of `READ` access to an environment in order to access a feature value.

==== Feature Permissions
For each application environment, there are permissions you can assign to portfolio groups or service accounts.

* `READ` Can see the value of a feature
* `LOCK` Can lock a feature, so it's value can't be changed, this gives us a
safety net when deploying incomplete code into production.
(Typically developers and testers keep features locked until they are finished and ready to be set)
* `UNLOCK` Can unlock a feature, so it's value can be changed
* `CHANGE_VALUE` Can change the value of a feature

All feature flags are automatically created in all environments, set to "off" and locked. 

NOTE: Groups can also separately be assigned the permission to create, edit and delete entire features.
