== Deployment options

There is a GitHub https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install[repository] where you can find source for all the deployment options.

=== Option 1 - Evaluation Deployment

image::images/fh_deployment_option_1.svg[Option 1,500]

This is the most basic option recommended for getting started quickly, and is the example we use in demos.

It uses one Docker container for the entire stack and works with all supported databases
baked in. The two web endpoints of interest -  the Management Server and the Edge layer that client
SDKs talk to - are all served from the same web server.

This deployment is designed with H2 in-memory database. It is not recommended for production usage,
and aimed for demonstration and evaluation purposes.

To install, grab the latest version of FeatureHub tagged release, e.g.

`curl https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install/archive/release-1.4.1.tar.gz -o featurehub.tar.gz | tar -xvz`

You can check for the latest versions https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install/releases[here] 

Make sure you have your docker running, and run the following commands from the folder where you saved the FeatureHub executable:

For H2 option:

`cd featurehub-install-release-1.2.0/docker-compose-options/all-in-one-h2`

`docker-compose up`

This will install all the necessary components including FeatureHub Admin Console. You can now load it on localhost:8085



=== Option 2 - Low Volume Deployment

This option is similar to the H2-in memory example, however in this case a single docker image with all FeatureHub components talks to the external database. (You can choose from Postgres or MySQL). This gives you more control over external database and lets you do single Docker image cloud deployments, however it doesn't scale well for large volume applications as all Edge traffic routes to the same container as your Admin application. It is possible that excess Edge
traffic will cause performance issues with your Admin app.


NOTE: In this `docker-compose` image, there is a sample database along with an initialization script. 

To install, grab the latest version of FeatureHub tagged release, e.g.

`curl https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install/archive/release-1.4.1.tar.gz -o featurehub.tar.gz | tar -xvz`

You can check for the latest versions https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install/releases[here]

Make sure you have your docker running, and run the following commands from the folder where you saved the FeatureHub executable:

For Postgres option:

`cd featurehub-install-release-1.4.1/docker-compose-options/all-in-one-postgres`

`docker-compose up`

Or for MySQL option:

`cd featurehub-install-release-1.4.1/docker-compose-options/all-in-one-mysql`

`docker-compose up`

This will install all the necessary components including FeatureHub Admin Console. You can now load it on localhost:8085

NOTE: H2 and Postgres are the two databases we test actively with. We are relying on our open source community to test MySQL database and report issues. 


=== Option 3 - Scalable Deployment

image::images/fh_deployment_option_3.svg[Option 2,500]

This option is best if you want to run FeatureHub in production at scale. Running separate instances of Edge, Cache, NATS and
FeatureHub Server, means you can deploy these components independently for scalability and redundancy.

In order to scale FeatureHub Server, you need to have first configured a separate database. We provide an installation option for this with Postgres database:

`cd featurehub-install-release-1.4.1/docker-compose-options/all-separate-postgres`

`docker-compose up`

There is also a helm chart available for production Kubernetes deployment. Please follow documentation link:https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install/tree/master/helm[here]

In this deployment, all components (MR, Dacha, NATS, Edge) are split into separate Docker containers, but
`docker-compose` runs them all in the same server. This example is intended to show you how you can
split and separate the configuration for each of these pieces.

Because they are deployed in separate containers, you have considerably greater control over what
network traffic gains access to each of these pieces, and they do not all sit under the same Web server. However,
because they run in a single Docker-Compose, they must run on different ports, which means you will need further
configuration to expose them in a normal organisation. This type of deployment is recommended for low volume traffic.

== Configuration

In the https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install/tree/master/docker-compose-options[deployment options]  configurations you will see that each server has
a set of possible external configurations. If you wish to build and rebundle the images yourself you can easily do this,
the base images, exposed ports and so forth are all configurable as part of the build.

NOTE: As of 1.4.1, all properties that are configured using `properties` files below can also be specified using environment
variables - but use the exact upper case variant. E.g. `db.url` becomes `DB.URL`, `passwordsalt.iterations` becomes
`PASSWORDSALT.ITERATIONS`. If you are running your FeatureHub on AWS ECS you will need to use environment variables
for configuration.

=== Run configuration

By this we mean the properties you can set to control the behaviour of different servers.

==== Management Repository

The following properties can be set:

- `db.url` - the jdbc url of the database server. 
- `db.username` -  the username used to log in.
- `db.password` - the password for the user
- `nats.urls` - a comma separated list of NATs servers. If null it simply won't publish.
- `passwordsalt.iterations` (1000) - how many iterations it will use to salt passwords
- `cache.pool-size` (10) - how many threads it will allocate to publishing changes to Dacha and SSE
- `feature-update.listener.enable` (true) - whether this MR should listen to the same topic as the Dacha's and respond if they are empty
-  `environment.production.name` (production) - the name given to the automatically created production environment. It will
be tagged "production".
- `environment.production.desc` (production) - the description field for same.
- `register.url` - the url used for registration. The front-end should strip the prefix off this and add its own relative one. The format has to
be `register.url=http://localhost:8085/register-url?token=%s` - if your site is `https://some.domain.info` for example, it would
be `register.url=https://some.domain.info/register-url?token=%s`
- `portfolio.admin.group.suffix` ("Administrators") - the suffix added to a portfolio group when a portfolio is created
for the first time, it needs an Admin group. So a portfolio called "Marketing" would get an admin group called "Marketing Administrators"
created. 

==== Dacha Config

The following properties can be set (that are meaningful):

- `nats.urls` - a comma separated list of NATs servers
- `cache.timeout` - how long the server will attempt to find and resolve a master cache before moving onto the next step (in ms, default = 5000)
- `cache.complete-timeout` - how long it will wait after another cache has negotiated master before it expects to see data (in ms, default = 15000)
- `cache.pool-size` - the number of threads in pool for doing "work" - defaults to 10

==== SSE-Edge Config

- `jersey.cors.headers` - a list of CORS headers that will be allowed, specifically for browser support
- `nats.urls` - a comma separated list of NATs servers
- `update.pool-size` (10) - how many threads to allocate to processing incoming updates from NATs. These are responses to feature
requests and feature updates coming from the server. 
- `listen.pool-size` (10) - how many threads to allocate to processing incoming requests to listen. This just takes the request, 
decodes it and sends it down via NATs and releases. 
- `maxSlots` (30) - how many seconds a client is allowed to listen for before being kicked off. Used to ensure connections
don't go stale.
- `dacha.url.<cache-name>` = url - this is only relevant if you are running split servers - so Dacha and Edge run in their own containers. You
need to tell Edge where Dacha is located. The default cache is called `default, so it will expect one called `dacha.url.default` and the url. In the
sample docker-compose where they are split, the hostname for Dacha is `dacha`, so this is `dacha.url.default=http://localhost:8094`. This isn't
required for the Party Server because communication is internal. 

==== Party Server

The party server honours all values set by the Management Repository, Dacha and the SSE-Edge.

==== Common to all servers 

All servers expose metrics and health checks. The metrics are for Prometheus and are on `/metrics`,
liveness is on `/health/liveness` and readyness on `/health/readyness`. Each different server has a collection
of what things are important to indicate aliveness. The `server.port` setting will expose these endpoints,
which means they are available to all of your normal API endpoints as well. In a cloud-native environment,
which FeatureHub is aimed at, this is rarely what you want. So FeatureHub has the ability to list these
endpoints on a different port.

- `monitor.port` (undefined) - if not defined, it will expose the metrics and health on the server port. 
If not, it will expose them on this port (and not on the server port).

All servers expose quite extensive metrics for Prometheus.

==== Common to Party, SSE Edge and Management Repository

- `server.port` (8903) - the server port that the server runs on. it always listens to 0.0.0.0 (all network interfaces)
- `server.gracePeriodInSeconds` (10) - this is how long the server will wait for connections to finish after it has stopped
listening to incoming traffic

Jersey specific config around logging is from here: https://github.com/ClearPointNZ/connect-java/tree/master/libraries/jersey-common[Connect jersey Common]

- `jersey.exclude`
- `jersey.tracing`
- `jersey.bufferSize` (8k) - how much data of a body to log before chopping off
- `jersey.logging.exclude-body-uris` - urls in which the body should be excluded from the logs
- `jersey.logging.exclude-entirely-uris` - urls in which the entire context should be excluded from the logs. Typically
you will include the /health/liveness and /health/readyness API calls along with the /metrics from this. You may also
wish to include login urls.
- `jersey.logging.verbosity` - the default level of verbosity for logging `HEADERS_ONLY, - PAYLOAD_TEXT, - PAYLOAD_ANY`

== Runtime Monitoring

=== Prometheus 

The Prometheus endpoint is on /metrics for each of the servers. It is exposed on the Party and MR Servers by default.

=== Health and Liveness checks

A server is deemed "Alive" once it is in STARTING or STARTED mode. It is deemed "Ready" when it is in STARTED mode. All
servers put themselves into STARTING mode as soon as they are able, and then STARTED once the server is actually 
listening. The urls are:

- `/health/liveness`
- `/health/readyness`

== Build 

Each of the different options, SSE-Edge, Dacha, the Management Repository and the Party Server build docker images
when called from Maven with a cloud image profile.

Make sure the developer build has been completed with:

----
cd backend && mvn -f pom-first.xml clean install && cd .. &&  mvn -T4C clean install
----

If you wish to do individual builds, which we recommend if you are overriding base images and so forth, cd into
those folders. First you will need to make sure the front end builds - it normally builds and installs as part of the
whole build process. Go into the `admin-frontend` folder and type:

----
mvn -Ddocker-cloud-build=true clean install
----

This is a docker build using a Flutter image of the front-end.

Then jump into your chosen folder and your command is:

----
mvn -Ddocker-cloud-build=true -Dapp.baseimage=docker://featurehub/base_mr:1.2 -Dapp.port=8085 -Dbuild.version=0.0.1 clean package
----

Where the `app.baseimage`, `app.port` and `build.version` are the versions you specify. The `docker://` prefix just means
it will pull it from Docker. It is using `jib` from Google, so you may wish to further play around with those settings.
