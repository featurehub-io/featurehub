== Admin Service Accounts

Admin service accounts are used for programmatic access to the FeatureHub's Management Repository API via an link:admin-development-kit{outfilesuffix}[Admin SDK API]. For example, you can use it to create applications, environments, features and perform operations on features. You can create an Admin Service Account if you are a super admin from the Admin Service Account page. Ensure you are providing enough permissions by adding it to a user group. (Users and Admin Service Accounts can share the same groups.)

When you create an Admin service account, ensure you copy the access token and store it safely as it won't be displayed afterwards in the UI. However, there is an option to reset the token if needed. There is also an option to remove token from a group.
