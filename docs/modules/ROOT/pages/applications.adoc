Application is where the feature flags will be created under. How you split your applications depends on your unique product requirements and feature flags arrangements for them.
You can create multiple applications in a portfolio. The number of applications is not limited. Every application will hold the features, feature values and environments.
You are required to provide an application name and a description when creating an application.
If you decide to delete an application, all features and environments associated with the application will be deleted.
Applications can only be created and managed with "Portfolio Admin" or "Organization Super Admin" permission.
