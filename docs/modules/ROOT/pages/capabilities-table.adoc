=== General Run Capabilities for SDKs
This overview seeks to indicate the capabilities of the SDKs and explain what they are and what the do.
If you are considering helping us by writing a new SDK for your favourite language, or expand on an existing library, this table of capability indicates what each different language can support and where extra work is helpful.

1. Javascript also includes Typescript

2. To apply rollout strategies (targeting and percentage rules) _user context_ is required to be passed to the SDKs and can be evaluated either on the client or server

3. Fastly CDN is supported for all existing SDKs for client evaluated keys only. As we roll through changes we will note `Y` in the column.
