= Configuration

== Run configuration

By this we mean the properties you can set to control the behaviour of different servers. As of 1.5.0 all
FeatureHub controller properties are available as environment variables using the same case. If you have been using
the mechanism introduced in 1.4.1 this still works but isn't recommended going forward.

NOTE: Please make sure you check out the https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install[`featurehub-install`] GitHub repository
and the https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-helm[`featurehub-helm`]
repository for examples on how these projects should be run and deployed.

If you are using a system like
Kubernetes, you can mount these properties in `/etc/app-config/application.properties` and
`/etc/app-config/secrets.properties`.


=== Database configuration

Only the Management Repository, Party Server, Party-Server-ish and Edge-REST deployments talk to the database.
Edge (streaming), Dacha1 and Dacha2 do not.

Configuration parameters:

- `db.url` - the jdbc url of the database server.
- `db.username` -  the username used to log in.
- `db.password` - the password for the user
- `db.minConnections` - the minimum number of connections to hold open (default 3)
- `db.maxConnections` - the maximum connections to open to the db (default 100)
- `db.pstmtCacheSize` - the prepared statement cache size (no default)

The library we use - ebean - supports a number of other configuration parameters

==== Database Read Replicas

We also support Read Replicas which are useful for deployments of `edge-rest`. We do not
recommend them for `mr`, `party-server` or `party-server-ish` deployments as read replicas have to behave
like being up to a couple of seconds out is ok. This is fine for `edge-rest` as it's major functionality
is reading via a GET. To use a read replica `db.` prefixes  use `db-replica` prefixes to configure a read replica,
where it is and how it should be connected to. Typically an `edge-rest` deployment will configure both of these (`db`
and `db-replica` parameters) but the corresponding `mr` will not.

== Async options for FeatureHub

If you use a streaming version of FeatureHub, you need an async layer and this has traditionally been NATS.
With the advent of Dacha2, the async layer is now a bigger topic.

NOTE: If you use Dacha1, you do not need to change anything, the preconfigured settings are sufficient.

To swap from Dacha1 (NATS only) to Dacha2 (all options), you need to set the environment variables:

- `dacha1.enabled=false` - disable Dacha1
- `dacha2.enabled=true` - enable Dacha2

=== NATS

The upside of NATS is simplicity and speed, it is the fastest product we test with by far. We do not use JetStream,
but you can configure it with JetStream if you wish. The downside is typically that your Operations team has to support
it, and it is an extra cost to deploy. The Kubernetes charts for NATS are extremely good and reliable.

==== Communication
NATS communicates using a protocol whereby the clients essentially tell the servers about each other, but they
do have to be able to communicate. Please read the https://docs.nats.io/[NATS documentation] for more information.

If you have only one instance of a
party-server you do not need to set anything. If you have deployed NATS yourself or are running multiple Party Servers,
you will need to set the environment variable:

- `nats.urls` - a comma separated list of NATs servers.

You do not need to configure anything further for NATS for Dacha1 or Dacha2. NATS supports request/reply,
true pub/sub and pub/queues in a single product.

=== Google's Pub/Sub

For Google's PubSub, you will need to turn NATS *off*. We consider Google Pub/Sub to be production ready as of 1.5.9.

- `nats.enabled=false`

And PubSub on:

- `cloudevents.pubsub.enabled=true`

You will also need to tell FeatureHub what the topics are for publishing on. You need to configure these across all
three applications.

- `cloudevents.pubsub.project=featurehub` - whatever the Google project ID you are deploying FeatureHub into
- `cloudevents.edge-mr.pubsub.topic-name=featurehub-edge-updates` - the name of the topic used by Edge to publish TestSDK updates back to MR
- `cloudevents.mr-edge.pubsub.topic-name=featurehub-mr-edge` - Feature Updates published from MR -> Edge for streaming clients
- `cloudevents.stats.pubsub.topic-name=featurehub-stats` - You only need to configure this if you have Stats publishing turned on, otherwise you can ignore it
- `cloudevents.mr-dacha2.pubsub.topic-name=featurehub-mr-dacha2` - the name of the topic MR publishes feature updates, environment updates and service account updates.
- `cloudevents.pubsub.min-backoff-delay-seconds=5` - Edge and Dacha must be able to create their own subscriptions. Google PubSub is not actually "pubsub", there is no way for all connections to a subscription
to receive a message, so this delay reflects how long PubSub should wait before trying to redeliver the message. Edge and Dacha will delete their subscriptions when they shut down, so keep this low.
- `cloudevents.mr-edge.pubsub.subscription-prefix=featurehub-edge-listener` - the prefix used for subscriptions created by Edge
- `cloudevents.mr-dacha2.pubsub.subscription-prefix=featurehub-dacha2-listener` - the prefix used for subscriptions created by Dacha2 instances

MR also needs an extra environment variable to tell it what subscription to listen to for updates from the TestSDK topic configured above (`cloudevents.edge-mr.pubsub.topic-name`):

- `cloudevents.inbound.channel-names=featurehub-edge-updates-mr-sub`

For testing locally there are extra fields if you are using the emulator - they are used in the `featurehub-installs` PubSub folder. To test in Google, we use https://www.pulumi.com/[Pulumi].

=== AWS Kinesis

We are supporting AWS Kinesis from v1.5.9 of FeatureHub

Disable NATS:

- `nats.enabled=false`

Enable Kinesis:

- `cloudevents.kinesis.enabled=true`

Then MR, Edge and MR need to know the streams settings:

- `cloudevents.mr-edge.kinesis.stream-name=featurehub-mr-edge` - the stream for MR -> Edge communication
- `cloudevents.mr-edge.kinesis.randomise-partition-key=false` - if you have > 1 shard, make sure this is true, unless you have a lot of traffic you probably don't need it
- `cloudevents.stats.kinesis.stream-name=featurehub-stats` - if you are publishing stats, the stream for doing so
- `cloudevents.mr-dacha2.kinesis.stream-name=featurehub-mr-dacha2` - the stream for MR -> Dacha2 communication
- `cloudevents.mr-dacha2.kinesis.randomise-partition-key=false` - if you have > 1 shard, make sure this is true, unless you have a lot of traffic you probably don't need it

MR needs to know the stream for TestSDK updates:

- `cloudevents.inbound.stream-names=featurehub-edge-updates` -

Edge needs to know the stream to publish on:

- `cloudevents.edge-mr.kinesis.stream-name=featurehub-edge-updates`

NOTE: We haven't conducted performance tests with AWS Kinesis, we recommend for you to run your own tests before using this setup in production

=== Management Repository

The following properties can be set:

- `passwordsalt.iterations` (1000) - how many iterations it will use to salt passwords
- `cache.pool-size` (10) - how many threads it will allocate to publishing changes to Dacha and SSE
- `feature-update.listener.enable` (true) - whether this MR should listen to the same topic as the Dacha's and respond if they are empty
-  `environment.production.name` (production) - the name given to the automatically created production environment. It will
be tagged "production".
- `environment.production.desc` (production) - the description field for same.
- `register.url` [[register-url, Register URL]] [*deprecated*] - the url used for registration. The front-end should strip the prefix off this and add its own relative one. The format has to
be `register.url=http://localhost:8085/register-url?token=%s` - if your site is `https://some.domain.info` for example, it would
be `register.url=https://some.domain.info/register-url?token=%s`. _This is honoured but no longer required and it is recommended to be removed._
- `portfolio.admin.group.suffix` ("Administrators") - the suffix added to a portfolio group when a portfolio is created
for the first time, it needs an Admin group. So a portfolio called "Marketing" would get an admin group called "Marketing Administrators"
created.
- `web.asset.location=/var/www/html/intranet` - can be set optionally if you are intending to serve the Admin web app on the intranet without public internet access. We supply this application build already preloaded with all necessary assets. Available in FeatureHub v1.5.4 and higher.
- `cache-control.web.index` - this allows you to set the Cache-Control header on the index.html file. It is set by default to `no-store, max-age=0` preventing any caching, so as new versions roll out, they are correctly picked up.
- `cache-control.web.other` - this sets the cache control on all of the other content of the website, which is essentially considered to be versioned. This data should never change and it is set by default to `max-age=864000` - or about 10 days.

=== Dacha1 Config

If you are using Dacha1 (the "active" cache), the following properties/environment variables can be set (that are meaningful):

- `cache.timeout` - how long the server will attempt to find and resolve a master cache before moving onto the next step (in ms, default = 5000)
- `cache.complete-timeout` - how long it will wait after another cache has negotiated master before it expects to see data (in ms, default = 15000)
- `cache.pool-size` - the number of threads in pool for doing "work" - defaults to 10

=== Dacha2 Config

If you are using Dacha2 (the "lazy" cache), then the following properties/environment variables can be set:

- `dacha2.cache.api-key` - if Dacha2 is available directly on the internet, it is recommended you set an API key to protect it.
Also set this on *Edge* (but only if Dacha2 is publicically exposed).

There are other configuration fields that allow you to not activetely cache incoming new environments or set the size of the LRU cache for data, but unless
you are getting memory issues or need to support more than 10000 active environments, it is not recommended you bother with these.

== Edge (all) Config

- `jersey.cors.headers` - a list of CORS headers that will be allowed, specifically for browser support
- `update.pool-size` (10) - how many threads to allocate to processing incoming updates from NATs. These are responses to feature
requests and feature updates coming from the server.
- `edge.cache-control.header` - specifically for the GET (polling) API, this lets your infrastructure limit
how often the clients can actually poll back. It would allow an infrastructure team to override individual
development teams on how often they wish polling to take place. It is generally not recommended to do this, but
there may be situations where it makes sense.

=== Edge (Streaming) Config

- `listen.pool-size` (10) - how many threads to allocate to processing incoming requests to listen. This just takes the request,
decodes it and sends it down via NATs and releases.
- `edge.sse.drop-after-seconds` (30) - how many seconds a client is allowed to listen for before being kicked off. Used to ensure connections
don't go stale. This was previously named `maxSlots` and a valid in that field is recognized.
- `edge.dacha.delay-slots` (10) - if Dacha is unavailable because it does not have a full cache, it will reject the request. For SSE, this creates a sliding window of a random delay in seconds, meaning a connection will be dropped in 1-10 seconds (by default). This is designed
to prevent reconnect storms as infrastructure is restarted.
- `edge.sse.heartbeat-period` (0) - if defined, Edge will attempt to send heartbeat signals down the SSE connection for the duration of the
connection while it is alive. If you set `edge.sse.drop-after-seconds` to 0, then the SSE connection will stay open, sending heartbeat
signals until the remote system drops the connection. This allows the heartbeat to be used as well as or instead of kicking SSE connections
off to ensure ghost connections.
- `dacha.url.default` = url - *You MUST specify this for Dacha2* this is only relevant if you are running split servers - so Dacha and Edge run in their own containers. You
need to tell Edge where Dacha is located. In the
sample docker-compose where they are split, the hostname for Dacha is `dacha`, so this is `dacha.url.default=http://localhost:8034`. This isn't
required for the Party Server because communication is internal.

=== Edge (REST only) Config

Edge REST uses the database, so it also needs the database config. Edge-REST
is bundled as a separate container, so it can be run and exposed directly
instead of being exposed along with the Admin site.

=== Party Server

The party server honours all values set by the Management Repository, Dacha and the SSE-Edge.

=== Party-Server-ish

The `party-server-ish` honours all the values set by the Management Repository  and Edge REST.

=== Common to all servers

All servers expose metrics and health checks. The metrics are for Prometheus and are on `/metrics`,
liveness is on `/health/liveness` and readyness on `/health/readyness`. Furthermore, every listening port responds with a 200 on
a request to `/` so that load balancers that aren't configured to listen to the proper readiness checks will function.

Each different server has a collection of what things are important to indicate aliveness.
The `server.port` setting will expose these endpoints,
which means they are available to all of your normal API endpoints as well. In a cloud-native environment,
which FeatureHub is aimed at, this is rarely what you want. So FeatureHub has the ability to list these
endpoints on a different port.

- `monitor.port` (undefined) - if not defined or `0`, it will expose the metrics and health on the server port.
If not, it will expose them on this port (and not on the server port). For systems like ECS where having > 1 port is not desirable, you should set it to `0`.
- `featurehub.url-path` - allows  to configure base path (context root) other than "/". This will set the base path in the index.html of the FeatureHub web app and the backend. Note, this is an offset, not a full domain name, e.g. `featurehub.url-path=/foo/featurehub`.
In case if the front-end is decoupled on a CDN, the base bath needs to be configured directly in index.html by setting: `<base href="/foo/featurehub/">` (note the trailing slash).
- `cache-control.api` - allows the configuration of the Cache-Control headings on all GET based API calls. This allows you to put a CDN in front of FeatureHub and ensure the CDN does not
cache any headers. It is on by default. See also the `cache-control.web` configuration for MR and Party Server.
- `cache-control.api.enabled` - set this to `false` if you wish to disable the Cache Control headers for APIs.
- `connect.logging.environment` - this is a comma separated value list that lets you pick up values from environment variables that get added directly to your logs. It is typically used in Kubernetes deploys to allow you to extract information from the k8s deploy and put it in environment variables and have them logged. The format is `<ENV-VAR>=<log-key>`. You can use `.` notation to split it into objects.

=== Common to Party, SSE Edge and Management Repository

- `server.port` (8903) - the server port that the server runs on. it always listens to 0.0.0.0 (all network interfaces)
- `server.gracePeriodInSeconds` (10) - this is how long the server will wait for connections to finish after it has stopped
listening to incoming traffic

Jersey specific config around logging is from here: https://github.com/ClearPointNZ/connect-java/tree/master/libraries/jersey-common[Connect jersey Common]

- `jersey.exclude`
- `jersey.tracing`
- `jersey.bufferSize` (8k) - how much data of a body to log before chopping off
- `jersey.logging.exclude-body-uris` - urls in which the body should be excluded from the logs
- `jersey.logging.exclude-entirely-uris` - urls in which the entire context should be excluded from the logs. Typically
you will include the /health/liveness and /health/readyness API calls along with the /metrics from this. You may also
wish to include login urls.
- `jersey.logging.verbosity` - the default level of verbosity for logging `HEADERS_ONLY, - PAYLOAD_TEXT, - PAYLOAD_ANY`

== Runtime Monitoring

=== Prometheus

The Prometheus endpoint is on /metrics for each of the servers. Extensive metrics are exposed on all services by
default. It is recommended that for public facing sites, you separate the monitoring port from the server port, so you
don't expose your health check or metrics endpoints to the public.

=== Health and Liveness checks

A server is deemed "Alive" once it is in STARTING or STARTED mode. It is deemed "Ready" when it is in STARTED mode. All
servers put themselves into STARTING mode as soon as they are able, and then STARTED once the server is actually
listening. The urls are:

- `/health/liveness`
- `/health/readyness`
