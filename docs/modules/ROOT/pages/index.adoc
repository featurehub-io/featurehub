Welcome to FeatureHub! - from the FeatureHub Team at <info@featurehub.io>

== Overview

https://www.featurehub.io/[FeatureHub] is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage their features, from feature flags (also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or centralised configuration.
It's an essential ingredient for enabling the feedback loop and feature testing and experimentation in production with real users (see diagram below).

Visit our official web page for more information about the platform https://www.featurehub.io/[here]

Building software with feature management encourages DevOps practices like

Enabling teams to deliver value to customers early and often, whilst maintaining high quality and keeping risk low.

FeatureHub can be used with small startups through to large enterprises with many applications and teams.
It has an enterprise grade security and permission model, that's intuitive and easy to use, so you can be up and running quickly.

FeatureHub is a self-hosted platform so you can run it on your own infrastructure.
