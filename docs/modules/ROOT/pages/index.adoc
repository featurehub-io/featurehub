== Overview

https://www.featurehub.io/[FeatureHub] is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage their features, from feature flags (also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or centralised configuration.
It's an essential ingredient for enabling the feedback loop and feature testing and experimentation in production with real users (see diagram below).

FeatureHub comes as a self-hosted platform, so you can run it on your own infrastructure. Alternatively, we also provide cloud hosted SaaS solution with a simple pay-as-you-go pricing. You

Building software with feature management encourages DevOps practices like

FeatureHub can be used with small startups through to large enterprises with many applications and teams.
It has an enterprise grade security and permission model, that's intuitive and easy to use, so you can be up and running quickly.

This documentation covers both Open Source and SaaS platforms.
