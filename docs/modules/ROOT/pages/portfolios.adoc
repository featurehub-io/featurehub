= Portfolios

Portfolios are simply a collection of one or more applications.
Typically, portfolios are named to match areas of your business where groups of applications (or application suites) live. E.g. "Digital", "Platforms", "Operations".
There is no limit to the number of portfolios you can have.
Portfolios can only be created and edited with "Super Admin" permission.
