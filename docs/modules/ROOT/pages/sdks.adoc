= FeatureHub SDKs


The client SDKs for FeatureHub are designed to allow various supported languages to connect to the Edge server and receive updates on the features.
Each SDK is designed to be idiomatic to that language. The capabilities of each SDK varies, please check the comparison table below.

== SDK API and OpenAPI files
We provide the API description in OpenAPI format.

You can either download and view the latest version
link:sdk-api-definition.html[here] or locate it on
https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/tree/main/infra/api-bucket/files/edge[GitHub]

Alternatively, it can be served from (filtered by version):

== Receiving Feature Updates

The SDK is typically broken into three main API calls:

- `GET` the basic HTTP GET API is used for polling, and is intended primarily for use by customer applications, such as
browsers and mobile clients. Polling time is configurable in the SDKs.
- `SSE` - holds a connection open to the server for as long as the server allows
and the server will push changes as they occur down to the client.This is generally recommended for server based applications
in a multi-threaded environment.Typically, Go, Java, .NET or standalone Python or Ruby services can use this.
- `PUT` this is the TEST API that FeatureHub provides, it is intended for QA Automated tests to allow QA environments to set feature values.

|===================================
||Recommended use case|URL| Known limitations
|GET|In browser and mobile applications, can also be used in server apps| /features?apiKey=your_key_value|
|PUT|Support test automation by controlling feature flag values|/features?apiKey=your_key_value | Updates only for default feature values, rollout strategies values updates are not supported
|SSE|In server applications for real-time streaming updates|connection initiated via GET to /features/{your_key_value} and reconnects automatically every 60 seconds | In FeatureHub SaaS, SSE is not supported with the use of the server eval API key (see link:sdks#_client_and_server_api_keys[here] for more details on API keys)
