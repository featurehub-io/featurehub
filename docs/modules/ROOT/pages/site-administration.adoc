= Site Administrators

There are two types of administrators, *Organization Super Admin* and *Portfolio Admin*.

== Organization Super Admin
* *Site Administrators* can:
** Create and manage users of the system
** Create and manage user groups
** Create and manage portfolios
** Create and manage Admin service accounts (to control FeatureHub via an ADK)

== Portfolio Administrators
* *Portfolio Administrators* can:
** Create and manage portfolio groups
** Create and manage applications
** Create and manage environments
** Manage users and groups access to applications
** Create service accounts

NOTE: Every Portfolio automatically gets a group called "Administrators", simply adding people to this group
will make them administrators for this portfolio.
