= Rollout strategies and targeting rules

== Rollout strategies

Rollout strategies provide an ability to roll out features to a segment of audience based on targeting rules. For example, a feature flag of type `string` which controls a _"button color"_ that can be in multiple states,
e.g. green, blue, red etc. With rollout strategies, you can serve a `green` value to users on `iOS` devices,
`blue` value to users whose emails ending with `gmail.com` and `red` value to users whose location is
`New Zealand or United States or United Kingdom`. You can also use percentage based rollouts and turn your feature "on" only to 50% of the audience.

Once you add a strategy you can set a link:features{outfilesuffix}[feature value] to serve to users that will match this strategy, for example "on" or "off". If a user doesn't match any of the provided strategies, they will be served a "default value". You can change the default strategy and rollout strategy feature values at any time (given you have permissions).

You can apply zero or more rollout strategies to a feature. Each rollout strategy can be assigned a different feature value. See link:strategies{outfilesuffix}[Rollout strategies evaluation order] for details on strategies ordering.

== Targeting rules
A rollout strategy consists of one or more targeting rules. The rule can consist of any combination of matching criteria.

Each additional rule is always applied as an `AND` condition - the user is using a mobile device that is iOS `AND`
their country is Australia.

*Example of a targeting rule*

Each rule is essentially a key, a condition (equals, includes, etc) and zero or more values. Whereas each rule
is an `AND` condition, each _value_ is an `OR` condition. For example, if the `country` is `New Zealand` `OR` `Indonesia`
`AND` the custom field `payment_method` is equal to `credit_card` `OR` `direct_debit`.

Each rollout strategy can have zero or more rules associated with it. If it has zero rules and no percentage rule
the strategy will be ignored. There is no limit on how many rules you can apply. There are 3 main rule types: *Preset*, *Custom* and *Percentage split*

== Targeting rule types

=== Preset rules

Preset rules are defined in FeatureHub SDKs and can be accessed via SDK functions, e.g. in JS SDK `await fhContext.country(StrategyAttributeCountryName.NewZealand).build();`

- Country

Available https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-countries-1993160[list of countries to match on]

- Device

Available values to match on:
`browser, mobile, desktop, server, watch, embedded`

- Platform

Available values to match on:

`linux, windows, macos, android, ios`

- User Key

For example, can be used to match on email address, partial email address, user id, partial user id or regex.

- Version

Requires to be in semantic version format, e.g. `1.2.0` -  read more about semantic versioning https://semver.org/[here]

=== Custom

If Preset rules do not satisfy your requirements you also have an ability to attach a custom rule.

*Supported custom rules types:*

`string`

`number` - any valid number

`boolean` - true and false

`semantic version` - as per semantic version format. If you are only targeting Java you also get the additional formats supported by Maven and Gradle.

`date` - international format only - `YYYY-MM-DD`

`date-time` - international format only - `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.NNN` with an optional timezone, UTC is assumed

`ip-address` - CIDR or specific IP addresses are supported.

To create a custom rule, select "Add split targeting rules" from the Feature editing menu and select "Custom" option. Enter "custom key", for example `languages`, set the type, e.g. `string`, a matching condition, e.g. `equals` and provide matching value or a list of values, e.g. `english, spanish, french`

image::fh_split_targeting_custom.png[Split targeting custom rule,1500]

When you need to evaluate a user in the SDK, you can pass the "custom key" and user attributes (in this case language attribute values), e.g. in JS SDK:

[source]
----
await fhContext.attributeValue('languages', 'italian').build();
----

or for an array of values:

[source]
----
await fhContext.attributeValue('languages', ['italian', 'english', 'german']).build();
----



NOTE: if you do not set the value in the _user context_ in the SDK, and the rule indicates to match `blank` value then this rule will evaluate to true.

== Percentage split rule

As well as setting up targeting rules you can also set up a special rule type - percentage split. Percentage rules lets you roll out a feature value to an approximate percentage of your user base.

A typical scenario for a flag for example would be a "soft launch". The "default value" of your flag would be `off` and you set some arbitrary percentage
to `on` (e.g. 20%). Then you would analyse how your feature is performing for those 20%, collect any user feedback, monitor your logging for any issues and if you are happy you will start
increasing the rollout to more and more people in your user base, eventually setting it to 100%, changing the default to
"on" and removing the strategy. (This is set _per environment_).

In case of multiple rollout strategies assigned to a feature that contain percentage split rules, the sum of all of them cannot be over 100%.
If you add percentage based rollout strategies that do not add to 100%, then the remainder continues to use the
default value.

You can also use percentage rules to perform *_A-B testing_* or *_run experiments_*. Given FeatureHub provides a Google Analytics connector - you can see the result of your experimentation in the Google Analytics Events dashboard in real time.

Percentage rules can be mixed with other rules, for example a strategy can have a country rule and a percentage rule, e.g. turn on the feature flag to 25% of the audience in New Zealand.

For Percentage rule to work you need to set a `Context` with `sessionId` or `userKey` when implementing feature flags through our SDKs. `userKey` can be anything that identifies your user, e.g `userId`, `email` etc..


NOTE: It is important to note that the percentages are an approximation, the algorithm works by taking user _Context_ data you provide
in SDK in the client side (either a `sessionId` or a `userKey`, ideally consistent for the user across platforms). It uses
an algorithm to spread that across a range giving you control down to four decimal points, but the algorithm is more accurate
the greater the number of clients you have. i.e. you can roll out to 0.0001% of your usage base if you wish.
If you only have five users, this probably won't turn a feature "on" for anyone, if you have a million it will
be more accurate.

== Rollout strategies evaluation order
As you can assign multiple rollout strategies to a feature, the order of the strategies becomes important. Strategies evaluated in order from first to last (in the Admin UI, as they are displayed from top to bottom), and stops when it hits a matching one. Strategies order can be set by dragging them in the Admin UI console - feature editing panel.
