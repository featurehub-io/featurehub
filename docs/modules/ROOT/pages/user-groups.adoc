= Portfolio groups

You can create one or more groups of people, these groups can be used to set various permissions
on the applications and their environments, within the portfolio. Either use the same groups across applications within the
portfolio, or create separate groups for each application.
Some example groups might be:

* _Developers_ (Typically can create features and change feature values in non-production environments)
* _Testers_ (Typically can change feature values in non-production environments)
* _Operations_ (Typically can't create or delete features but can update values in production)

NOTE: Every Portfolio automatically gets a group called "Administrators", Simply adding people to this group will
make them administrators for this portfolio, and they automatically get all feature permissions in any application within that Portfolio.

You can also add Admin Service Accounts to the user groups for programmatic control via link:admin-development-kit{outfilesuffix}[Admin SDK API]

== Group permissions to control features
For each application environment, there are permissions you can assign to portfolio groups

* Special permission to `create`, `edit` and `delete` entire feature.

* `READ` Can see the value of a feature
* `LOCK` Can lock a feature, so it's value can't be changed, this gives us a
safety net when deploying incomplete code into production.
(Typically developers and testers keep features locked until they are finished and ready to be set)
* `UNLOCK` Can unlock a feature, so it's value can be changed
* `CHANGE_VALUE` Can change the value of a feature or can "retire" a feature
