== User groups

Groups primary purpose is to control FeatureHub user access to the features per application and environments.
Groups are created under a portfolio. You can create one or more groups and use them to set various permissions
within the portfolio. Either use the same groups across applications within the
portfolio, or create separate groups for each application.
Some example groups might be:

* _Developers_ (Typically can create features and change feature values in non-production environments)
* _Testers_ (Typically can change feature values in non-production environments)
* _Operations_ (Typically can't create or delete features but can update values in production)

NOTE: Every Portfolio automatically gets a group called "Administrators", Simply adding people to this group will
make them administrators for this portfolio, and they automatically get all feature permissions in any application within that Portfolio.

Once you create a group, you can add users in your organization to it.

You can also add Admin Service Accounts to the user groups for programmatic control via link:admin-development-kit{outfilesuffix}[Admin SDK API]

== Group permissions to control features
For each application environment, there are permissions you can assign to portfolio groups

* Special permission to `create`, `edit` and `delete` entire feature.

* `READ` Can see the value of a feature
* `LOCK` Can lock a feature, so it's value can't be changed, this gives us a
safety net when deploying incomplete code into production.
(Typically developers and testers keep features locked until they are finished and ready to be set)
* `UNLOCK` Can unlock a feature, so it's value can be changed
* `CHANGE_VALUE` Can change the value of a feature or can "retire" a feature

== Administrator groups

There are two types of administrator groups, *Organization Super Admin* and *Portfolio Admin*.

== Organization Super Admin
* *Site Administrators* can:
** Create and manage users of the system
** Create and manage user groups
** Create and manage portfolios
** Create and manage Admin service accounts
** Create and manage features in any portfolio, application and environment.

In other words, organization super admin has got all privileges, hence it is recommended to have at least 2 super admins, in case one of them leaves the organization.

== Portfolio Administrators
* *Portfolio Administrators* can:
** Create and manage portfolio groups
** Create and manage applications
** Create and manage environments
** Create and manage service accounts
** Manage groups access to applications
** Add and delete user from a group

NOTE: Every Portfolio automatically gets a group called "Administrators", simply adding people to this group
will make them administrators for this portfolio.
