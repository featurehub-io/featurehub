= Webhooks configuration

This section explains if additional configuration is needed to support webhooks functionality.

NOTE: If your installation is using NATS, you are not required to do any additional configuration, NATS will automatically start
processing updates for environments/features relevant to the webhooks.

If your installation is using Pub/Sub, you will need to do additional configuration as described below.

== Dacha2

For PubSub, when feature updates travel from MR -> Dacha2, Dacha2 will take the well known topic
and create its own subscription dynamically, and will destroy it on shutting down.

Webhooks use the new Feature Enrichment pipeline, which will take the single
feature update (e.g. a feature changed, was added or was deleted), and pull all of the environment's
data out of the cache and then publish the complete set of Feature data for that environment. But
you only want *one* of the Dacha2 instances processing that. As such, you need to a new subscriber
just for the enrichment pipeline.

== Publishing Events

Once Dacha2 has enriched the data, it needs to publish it back out again on one or more new topics.
This allows you to easily create pools of topic/subscriber pairs. As such, we only actually have one
topic, but it is configured to support further listeners to the enrichment pipeline - you can add your
own if you wish to have an application being updated via a subscription for example.

The configuration uses the fairly standard list of keys, and then uses those keys to look for
further configuration.

In the example below `featurehub-enriched-events-webhooks` is the name of the Topic that
Dacha2 will attempt to publish the enriched data on.

----
# when pubsub publishes the enriched data, it needs to specify one or more topics to publish on.
cloudevents.enricher.pubsub.channels=webhooks
cloudevents.enricher.pubsub.channel.webhooks=featurehub-enriched-events-webhooks
----

== Edge

Edge is currently the application that listens for webhook related enriched data. You need
to create a topic/subscription pairing and use that subscription pair on the configuration below.
Here we have assumed your infrastructure-as-code has provided you a name like `featurehub-enriched-events`
as the subscription.

----
# "edge" listening to the cloudevents.enricher.channel-name topic

cloudevents.enricher.pubsub.enriched-subscription-name=featurehub-enriched-events
----

== Architecture Overview

FeatureHub uses CloudEvents to ship any asynchronous events.
