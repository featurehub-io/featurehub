= Webhooks

With the 1.6.0 release comes a new feature of Webhooks. This allows you to configure a URL endpoint
and appropriate authorisation or configuration headers, and the application will deliver the complete
set of feature flags changes to that endpoint. E.g. changes of feature values, adding or deleting features.
Configuration is done per environment.

== Usage

Webhooks are designed to be per environment - you can have one webhook per environment. The system
allows you to configure, enable/disable and test your webhook, and see what the results of the webhook
are. All attempts at delivery are captured and stored in the system.

The Webhook UI allows you to see the webhook traffic for a given environment.

You can also drill down into the details of an individual request.

You can configure a webhook as shown on the screen below: the enabled status, the url destination, and any extra headers you need. Once you have
saved it, you can test it and the result will show up on the Webhook Traffic page. Test button will only appear if webhook is enabled.

== Data Format

The data is formatted in an OpenAPI document. The latest release
is in the `releases.json` file at http://api.dev.featurehub.io/webhooks/releases.json[API Releases].
To find the actual OpenAPI document, replace `releases.json` with the version.yaml, e.g.
http://api.dev.featurehub.io/webhooks/1.1.1.yaml[Version 1.1.1]

At the top level, it looks like this, where the full details of features are available, along with an array of features that actually changed.
