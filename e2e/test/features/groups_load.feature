Feature: This should test the loading of new groups

  Scenario Outline: I can create a new portfolio and groups 3

    # superuser has to create the portfolio and create the user
    Given I ensure a portfolio named "<portfolio>" with description "<portfolio_desc>" exists
    And I have a fully registered person "<name>" with email "<email>" and password "password123"
    # previous step swapped to that user, so swap back to superuser
    And the first superuser is used for authentication
    # they are also the only ones who can add users initially to the portfolio admin group's group
    And I ensure the "<email>" user is added to the portfolio admin group for "<portfolio>"
    # lets swap to the newly created user and do the rest as them
    When I can login as user "<email>" with password "password123"
    When I ensure a portfolio "<portfolio>" has created a group called "<group>"
    Then portfolio "<portfolio>" has group "<group>"

  Examples:
    | portfolio   | portfolio_desc | group                      | name                    | email                                  |
