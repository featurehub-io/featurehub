Feature: This set of scenarios tests the connection when running the party server, or the whole triple



  @EdgeListener @PartyServer
  Scenario: When I create a fully functioning environment with features, changes come through in a timely fashion
    Given the first superuser is used for authentication
    And I have a randomly named portfolio with the prefix "party_server"
    And I create an application with the name "party server app"
    And I create an environment "dev"
    And I create a feature flag "FEATURE_PARTY"
    And We create a service account "PARTY_ACCOUNT" with the permission READ
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    Then We listen for party server edge features from the shared service account
    And the feature repository reports the following:
      | feature       | valueBoolean |
      | FEATURE_PARTY | false        |
    And I unlock the feature value for environment "dev" for feature "FEATURE_PARTY"
    And I set the boolean feature value as "true" for environment "dev" for feature "FEATURE_PARTY"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And the feature repository reports the following:
      | feature       | valueBoolean |
      | FEATURE_PARTY | true         |
