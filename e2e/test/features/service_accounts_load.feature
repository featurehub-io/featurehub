Feature: This should test the loading of new service accounts

  Scenario Outline: I can create a new portfolio and groups 3

    # superuser has to create the portfolio and create the user
    Given I ensure a portfolio named "<portfolio>" with description "<portfolio_desc>" exists
    And I have a fully registered person "<name>" with email "<email>" and password "password123"
    # previous step swapped to that user, so swap back to superuser
    And the first superuser is used for authentication
    And I ensure the "<email>" user is added to the portfolio admin group for "<portfolio>"
    # lets swap to the newly created user and do the rest as them
    When I can login as user "<email>" with password "password123"
    When I ensure a portfolio "<portfolio>" has created a service account called "<service_account>"
    Then portfolio "<portfolio>" has service account "<service_account>"

    Examples:
      | portfolio   | portfolio_desc | service_account | name                    | email                                  |

  Scenario Outline: I can create a new portfolio and service account and add permissions

    # superuser has to create the portfolio and create the user
    Given I ensure a portfolio named "<portfolio>" with description "<portfolio_desc>" exists
    And I have a fully registered person "<name>" with email "<email>" and password "password123"
    # previous step swapped to that user, so swap back to superuser
    And the first superuser is used for authentication
    And I ensure the "<email>" user is added to the portfolio admin group for "<portfolio>"
    When I ensure a portfolio "<portfolio>" has created application called "<app>" and environment "<environment>" and service account called "<service_account>" and permission type "<permission_type>"
    Then portfolio "<portfolio>" has service account "<service_account>" and the permission "<permission_type>" for this "<app>" and "<environment>"

    Examples:
      | portfolio   | portfolio_desc | service_account | name                    | email                                  | permission_type | app          | environment |

  Scenario Outline: I can reset api keys for a service account as a super user

   # superuser has to create the portfolio and create the user
    Given I ensure a portfolio named "<portfolio>" with description "<portfolio_desc>" exists
    And I have a fully registered person "<name>" with email "<email>" and password "password123"
    # previous step swapped to that user, so swap back to superuser
    And the first superuser is used for authentication
    And I ensure the "<email>" user is added to the portfolio admin group for "<portfolio>"
    When I ensure a portfolio "<portfolio>" has created application called "<app>" and environment "<environment>" and service account called "<service_account>" and permission type "<permission_type>"
    Then portfolio "<portfolio>" has service account "<service_account>" and the permission "<permission_type>" for this "<app>" and "<environment>"
    Then I should be able to reset client keys for service account "<service_account>" for portfolio "<portfolio>" for application "<app>" for environment "<environment>"
    Then I should be able to reset server keys for service account "<service_account>" for portfolio "<portfolio>" for application "<app>" for environment "<environment>"

    Examples:
      | portfolio   | portfolio_desc | service_account | name                    | email                                  | permission_type | app          | environment |
