== SDK Examples
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

The SDK Examples consist of  three variants

- link:todo-backend-java/README{outfilesuffix}[Java backend server]
- link:todo-backend-typescript/README{outfilesuffix}[Typescript backend server]

Both of these will work for the link:todo-frontend-react-typescript/README{outfilesuffix}[React frontend] (which also uses features).
