== the base_party image

This contains the base of the Party Server, including NATs Server and the Open JRE v11.

It is used by the Party Server build to create a build.

It is built using make-image.sh

Once built, you can login to DockerHub (`docker login` - use `docker logout` if you are logged in using 
something else).
