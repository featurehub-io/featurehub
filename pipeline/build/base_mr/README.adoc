== the base_mr image

This contains the base of the Management Repository, including nginx, the Admin UI and the Open JRE v11.

It is used by the Management Repository build to create a build.

It is built using make-image.sh

Once built, you can login to DockerHub (`docker login` - use `docker logout` if you are logged in using 
something else).
