//Building software with feature management encourages DevOps practices like
//http://trunkbaseddevelopment.com[trunk based development], continuous delivery and importantly,
//separating deployment from releasing. Enabling teams to deliver value to customers early and often,
//whilst maintaining high quality and keeping risk low.
