== Documentation

Full documentation can be found at https://docs.featurehub.io[docs.featurehub.io]

=== Getting started

If you are just curious to see how FeatureHub works and would like to play with it there is a simple way of doing it,
please follow instructions https://docs.featurehub.io/#_starting_small[here].

Once you have decided to start using FeatureHub in your team, there are also several installation options
depending on your use case, please read about these options https://docs.featurehub.io/#_installation[here].

Note: We have a separate https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install[install repository] with configured docker images

We selectively take cuts of the main repository and build them into docker image sets. We then
update install repository with the latest images and issue tags on that repository.

== Coming soon

* Feature auditing
* SDK's : Python, Ruby
* Yaml remote configuration support

== Contributing

FeatureHub is an open source project, and we love to receive contributions from our community!
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into FeatureHub itself.


=== Further information for contributors

If you have reviewed the https://docs.featurehub.io/architecture.html[Architecture section] of the FeatureHub
documentation you will notice there are several components. FeatureHub is designed this way to allow
to scale from a single application option to large organisations serving billions
of requests for features per day.

==== The Backend Servers

The Management Repository, Dacha (the Cache layer) and Edge (where all clients connect
via their service accounts) are all written in _Java_. This allows us to build fully scalable
software. In our simple examples, it all deploys together in one simple
bundle. In complex examples it can all be sliced apart, sharded and massively scaled. Apart from Java, we use a few other technologies as well which will
help OpenAPI, JAX-RS (specifically Jersey), Maven (specifically with Maven Tiles), and Ebean for our ORM.

Java was also chosen amongst the JVM stack because of its ability to allow the greatest number of people to
contribute. The `pom.xml`  in the main repository to allow for easy loading and local installation
of the project. It is called a _reactor_.

If you want to go more advanced, we also support Prometheus, Health Checks, OpenTracing and Jaeger.

==== The FeatureHub Admin Console

The Admin front end is written in Flutter Web. This choice gives us a wide range
of platforms (Web, mobile, native platforms) we can target from the same codebase. Currently, Web platform is our priority. If you want
to contribute to the Admin Console - we would love you to join us!

==== The SDKs

If you are planning on helping us by building an SDK in a language we don't yet support, please refer to this https://docs.featurehub.io/sdks-development.html[documentation]. We are happy to get contributions that slowly add full
functionality for a new language.
