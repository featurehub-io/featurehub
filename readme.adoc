FeatureHub is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage their features, from feature flags (also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or centralised configuration.
This is the primary source code repository for FeatureHub.

https://demo.featurehub.io[Try FeatureHub demo now]

**Install with Docker (evaluation mode)**

```
$ docker run -p 8085:8085 --user 999:999 -v $HOME/party:/db featurehub/party-server:latest
```

Once installed, head to http://localhost:8085 to see FeatureHub Admin Console in action

image::docs/images/fh-features-console-dark.png[FeatureHub console demo,800]

**Connect to FeatureHub in your app via SDK**

1. Create an application, an environment and a feature from the Admin Console

2. Create and copy the API Key (client or server eval) from the Admin Console on the API Keys page.

3. Create FeatureHub config and start using feature flags in your app (see Typescript example below). For more SDKs and examples please see https://docs.featurehub.io/featurehub/latest/sdks.html#_sdk_usage[here]

```typescript
import {
  EdgeFeatureHubConfig,
} from 'featurehub-javascript-client-sdk';

const edgeUrl = 'http://localhost:8085/';
const apiKey = 'default/3f7a1a34-642b-4054-a82f-1ca2d14633ed/aH0l9TDXzauYq6rKQzVUPwbzmzGRqe*oPqyYqhUlVC50RxAzSmx';

const fhConfig = new EdgeFeatureHubConfig(edgeUrl, apiKey);

fhConfig.init();
const fhClient = await fhConfig.newContext().build();
if(fhClient.getFlag('FEATURE_KEY')) {
  // do something
}
else {
  //do something else
}

```

== FeatureHub API

https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/tree/main/infra/api-bucket/files/mrapi[Headless API] is available to manage FeatureHub app if you require automation or prefer not to use Admin Console to manage features.
