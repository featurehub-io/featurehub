FeatureHub is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage their features, from feature flags (also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or centralised configuration.

FeatureHub is available as a self-hosted Open Source service and as a cloud based SaaS service.

This is the primary source code repository for FeatureHub Open Source.

*FeatureHub SaaS - join hosted cloud service*

FeatureHub service is now available as a SaaS offering. You can join today https://app.featurehub.io/[here]. No credit card required and a 30-day free trial is available.

Documentation specific to SaaS service can be found https://docs.featurehub.io/featurehub/latest/hosted/index.html[here]


*FeatureHub Open Source - Install with Docker (evaluation mode)*

```
$ docker run -p 8085:8085 --user 999:999 -v $HOME/party:/db featurehub/party-server:latest
```

Once installed, head to http://localhost:8085 to see FeatureHub Admin Console in action

image::docs/images/features-console-v2.png[FeatureHub console demo,800]

**Connect to FeatureHub in your app via SDK**

1. Create an application, an environment and a feature from the Admin Console

2. Create and copy the API Key (client or server eval) from the Admin Console on the API Keys page.

3. Create FeatureHub config and start using feature flags in your app (see Typescript example below). For more SDKs and examples please see https://docs.featurehub.io/featurehub/latest/sdks.html#_sdk_usage[here]

```typescript
import {
  EdgeFeatureHubConfig,
} from 'featurehub-javascript-client-sdk';

const edgeUrl = 'http://localhost:8085/'; // for SaaS version, replace with edge URL provided in the API Keys page
const apiKey = 'default/3f7a1a34-642b-4054-a82f-1ca2d14633ed/aH0l9TDXzauYq6rKQzVUPwbzmzGRqe*oPqyYqhUlVC50RxAzSmx';

const fhConfig = new EdgeFeatureHubConfig(edgeUrl, apiKey);

fhConfig.init();
const fhClient = await fhConfig.newContext().build();
if(fhClient.getFlag('FEATURE_KEY')) {
  // do something
}
else {
  //do something else
}

```

== FeatureHub API

https://docs.featurehub.io/featurehub/latest/api-definition.html[Headless API] is available to manage FeatureHub app if you require automation or prefer not to use Admin Console to manage features. API is provided in https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/tree/main/infra/api-bucket/files/mrapi[OpenAPI format] and can be imported into Postman or similar tools. Follow https://docs.featurehub.io/featurehub/latest/admin-service-accounts.html[this documentation] to generate access tokens.

https://docs.featurehub.io/featurehub/latest/sdk-api-definition.html[SDK API] is also available. This is an API that is used to retrieve feature states in various SDKs that we provide. Open API file can be located https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/tree/main/infra/api-bucket/files/edge[here]
