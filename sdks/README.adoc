= Client SDKs for Feature Hub

The client SDKs for FeatureHub are designed to allow various supported languages to connect to the
Edge server and receive updates on the features. Each different SDK is designed to be idiomatic to that
language, but also each different SDK is expected to be used for a different purpose, and so capability varies.

This overview seeks to indicate the capabilities of the SDKs and explain what they are and do. If you are
considering helping us by writing a new SDK for your favourite language, or expand on an existing library, this
table of capability indicates what each different language can support and where extra work is helpful.

== Licenses

All SDKs are MIT licensed, as they reside in the client codebase.

== Capabilities in detail

=== Event Streaming

This relates to the primary purpose of the FeatureHub platform, which is a platform by which a client is
able to connect and then receive a constant stream of real-time updates to the features as they change. This 
mechanism is supported via Server Side Events.

=== Background Start

This relates to the ability for the application to connect to a FeatureHub Edge server in the background and 
complete the initial transactions and continue listening for updates - all in the background.

=== Block until Start

This is usually a capability provided instead of readyness listeners, whereby the library can be told to wait
until the connection has been successfully established and there is a list of features, or the connection fails for
some reason. It is used to ensure a client has a consistent set of features before functioning and is generally best
used for server side software.

=== Readyness Listeners

These perform a similar function to Block until Start, but instead a server can call back or query the readyness
status directly and perform the blocking function themselves. The ToDo Java and Typescript examples use this mechanism.

=== Feature Listeners

This allows client code to listen for changes in the state of a feature, and to trigger some action based on the new
state. Generally the whole feature is passed to the listener for it to interrogate.

=== Feature Listener Removal

Some clients like to, or need to (usually UI related) remove listeners they have created. This allows them to do that.

=== Catch & Release

Some clients don't want the features to be immediately triggered. These are usually those that use Feature Listeners
and they want to hold onto the changes until they have informed the user there are changes - via some UI element (e.g.
reload for new functionality). Catch and release mode normally includes a flag to set it, an extra callback to indicate
new features have come in, and then a release method to indicate the new features should be released (their state changed
and the listeners triggered). The Typescript, Javascript and Dart libraries all have examples of this.

=== Analytics Support

This is where the library has a mechanism to log an event, potentially attach metadata. The library captures the state of
all of the features at the point in time of the request and will pass it on to any registered Analytics provider. A platform
can have analytics support but no analytics providers. We intend over time to support only one, where the data is posted
to a backend service which you can then decide where to send and how to send the data.

=== Google Analytics

This is a client side implementation of the Analytics support. It is designed so you need to specify the `User-ID` or `CID`,
your `UA-` id and when logging an event, it will fire off into GA the event - one for each value of non-JSON features.

=== Test Client / Feature Updater

This is designed to allow tests to change the values of features in their environments while they are running. For 
integration or e2e tests that run sequentially in an environment it is a useful feature, but for load 
balanced tests running a variety of feature
profiles all against the same environment, it is better to use OpenTracing or OpenTelemetry. We will support this directly
in the future. 

This will depend on the permissions granted to the service account in the environment that is configured. If the service account
only has READ access, no changes will be allowed. A typical service account would need UNLOCK and CHANGE_VALUE. Alternatively
if features are always unlocked in test environments (which is usual), CHANGE_VALUE is all that is required, and READ is
implicit.

Changes are checked against the latest version of the feature in the cache. Changes that match the current state are
simply ignored (and a 200 response given). Changes generally take a second or two to propagate.

For other cases, the `FeatureStateUpdate` class has three fields.

- `lock` - if passed it will change the state of the lock. You need LOCK permission to lock, UNLOCK permission to
unlock. If a feature is locked, any attempt to change it will be ignored.
- `value` - this is an "object" because it represents all types of values supported. It can be null. If it is null,
and you want to ensure this is set to null (which is ignored for feature flags), make sure you set `updateValue`.
- `updateValue` - this is specifically for the situation where you are setting a non feature flag to have a null value.
Otherwise passing a value will assume this is true.
