# A Flutter Example

This is a simple Flutter example and it uses the GET api to ensure the radio is kept on.
In this case, the Refresh Indicator is used to request updated features which
trigger the stream to update and repaint the screen. 

It expects a string feature called FLUTTER_COLOUR to exist and have values of 
blue, purple or yellow.
