= Java Libraries

This is the set of libraries currently supporting the Java programming language and its JDK based cousins. It currently consists
of two libraries:

- link:client-java-core/README.adoc[Core] - this reflects the core repository and all listeners that notify about feature changes.
- link:client-java-jersey/README.adoc[Jersey Client] - this reflects the Jersey Eventsource client for Java. It also includes
the Jersey implementation of the Google Analytics provider.

Other libraries for Spring and other platforms will arrive once they have been built.
