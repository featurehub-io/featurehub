= FeatureHub SDK for Android/Polling

== Overview
This SDK is intended for client libraries, particularly for Android as keeping the radio on would drain the battery
quickly. It does this by making GET requests for the data, and you are in control of how often it requests (there
is no automatic polling mechanism).

This library uses:

- OKHttp 4 (for http)
- Jackson 2.11 (for json)
- SLF4j (for logging)

If you need your Android client to use another technology, please let us know or feel free to contribute another version.

Visit our official web page for more information about the platform https://www.featurehub.io/[here]

== Using on Android

As it requires internet access, you will need to add to your `AndroidManifest.xml` the usual:

`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>`

If you are using it locally and not behind https, you will also need to specify an attribute on your `<application>` tag,
which allows clear text traffic.

`android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`

You will need to store your repository in a central location, using a static or via a DI tool like Dagger.Using a static
might look something like this:

Core uses Java's ServiceLoader capability to automatically discover the JerseyClient implementation. Please
simply follow the instructions in the https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/tree/master/sdks/java/client-java-core[Java Core library].

As per that documentation you can manually configure the Edge provider to be the `AndroidFeatureHubClientFactory` if 
you wish.
