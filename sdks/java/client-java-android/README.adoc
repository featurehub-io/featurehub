= FeatureHub SDK for Android

== Overview
This SDK implementation updates the FeatureHub repository by making HTTP GET requests when the Android client wishes
to make requests. This is done because Server Sent Events keep the radio on all the time, and are expensive for battery
life and for data traffic (as they get kicked off the server and have to reestablish their connections). 

This library uses:

- OKHttp 4 (for http)
- Jackson 2.11 (for json)
- SLF4j (for logging)

If you need your Android client to use another technology, please let us know or contribute another version. 

== Use of the API

The API is fairly straightforward to use. You:

- Create a repository as a singleton, listen for events as per normal. Please see link:../client-java-core/README.adoc[Java client] for more details.
- Create a `FeatureHubClient`, 
- pass in the base host address of SSE Edge - e.g. `http://localhost:8553`
- pass in one of more SDK URLs - those copied from the Admin UI
- when you want data, hit poll. It will asynchronously get the data and fill, it will not operate on the UI thread, and
it will prevent you from asking again while a request is in flight.

An simplistic pure Java client example might be:

[source,java]
----
    ClientFeatureRepository repo = new ClientFeatureRepository(1);
    repo.addReadynessListener(rl -> System.out.println("readyness " + rl.toString()));

    final FeatureHubClient client = new FeatureHubClient("http://localhost:8553",
      Collections.singleton("default/ce6b5f90-2a8a-4b29-b10f-7f1c98d878fe/VNftuX5LV6PoazPZsEEIBujM4OBqA1Iv9f9cBGho2LJylvxXMXKGxwD14xt2d7Ma3GHTsdsSO8DTvAYF")
      , repo);

    client.checkForUpdates();

    System.out.println("waiting");
    System.in.read();
----

== Using on Android

As it requires internet access, you will need to add to your `AndroidManifest.xml` the usual:

`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>`

If you are using it locally and not behind https, you will also need to specify an attribute on your `<application>` tag,
which allows clear text traffic.

`android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`

You will need to store your repository in a central location, using a static or via a DI tool like Dagger. Using a static
might look something like this:

[source,java]
----
import io.featurehub.android.FeatureHubClient;
import io.featurehub.client.FeatureRepository;

import java.util.Collections;

public class SharedRepository {
    public static FeatureRepository repository;
    public static boolean initialized = false;
    public static FeatureHubClient client;

    public static void init() {
        if (!initialized) {
            repository = new ClientFeatureRepository(1);
            initialized = true;
            client = new FeatureHubClient("http://10.0.2.2:8553", // 10.0.2.2 is the host running in the emulator
                    Collections.singletonList("default/ce6b5f90-2a8a-4b29-b10f-7f1c98d878fe/VNftuX5LV6PoazPZsEEIBujM4OBqA1Iv9f9cBGho2LJylvxXMXKGxwD14xt2d7Ma3GHTsdsSO8DTvAYF"),
                    repository);
            client.checkForUpdates();
        }
    }

    public static void refresh() {
        client.checkForUpdates();
    }
}
----

You can then proceed in your code either to react to events and put them in streams to get your application updating, or
imperatively querying for data. You may wish to provide defaults for some features, we will be providing on-disk caching
to enable sensible startups in the future.

[source, kotlin]
----
view.findViewById<TextView>(R.id.textview_first).text =
    SharedRepository.repository.getFeatureState("FIRST_FRAG").string ?: "First fragment";
