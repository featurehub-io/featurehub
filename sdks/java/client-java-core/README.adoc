= Java Client SDK for FeatureHub
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

Welcome to the Java implementation for FeatureHub.
It is the supported version, but it does not mean you cannot write your own, the functionality is quite straightforward.

Visit our official web page for more information about the platform https://www.featurehub.io/[here]

== Overview

This is the core library for Java.

It provides the core functionality of the repository which holds features and creates events.
It does not connect to the backend server.
As that will depend on whatever HTTP client java library you use, we have provided one for Jersey.
We expect to provide future libraries for various other popular HTTP libraries.

This library only provides one recommended type of operation, which is that the server will update all the features
all of the time.

NOTE: This readme does not deal with the SDK capability of updating features while running your tests. That
capability is API client specific, and the sample we have is for Jersey. link:../client-java-jersey/README{outfilesuffix}[It is documented here.]

== Using the Java Feature SDK

Because this is the Java SDK, and it can be used in a back-end service or Android, there are two ways of
interacting with this service. Only one is currently supported and is not recommended for Android as
it keeps the radio on. This will come in later in our roadmap.

=== 1. All the Features, All the Time

In this mode, you will make a connection to the FeatureHub Edge server, and any updates to any events will come
through to you, updating the feature values in the repository. You can choose to listen for these updates and update
some UI immediate, but every `if` statement will indicate the updated value, so listening is usually a better choice.

A typical strategy will be:

. create a feature hub repository, wire it into your application stack as appropriate.
. set up and wire up your application. initialize your server, but don't start it.
. set up a readyness listener so you know when the features have loaded and you have an initial state for them. When
you get a `Ready` state, start the server listening. If you get a `Failed` then shut your server down or continue
without a set of features.
. [optional] set up your per feature listeners so you can react to their changes in state. You can operate
in a imperative (is this feature on?) and/or reactive (callback) way with the repository.

This kind of operation is perfect for servers.It can lead to instant change which could confuse users in a UI and
isn't something our team recommends.

An example using our Jersey client.

[source,java]
----
ClientFeatureRepository cfr = new ClientFeatureRepository(5);

// the static feature context is a convenience interface 
StaticFeatureContext.repository = cfr;

// configure and immediately connect and attempt to listen
new JerseyClient(featureHubUrl, true, cfr);

// ... 

final HttpServer server = GrizzlyHttpServerFactory.createHttpServer(BASE_URI, config, false);

cfr.addReadynessListener((ready) -> {
  if (ready == Readyness.Ready) {
    try {
      server.start();
    } catch (IOException e) {
      log.error("Failed to start", e);
      throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }

    log.info("Application started. (HTTP/2 enabled!) -> {}", BASE_URI);
  } else if (ready == Readyness.Failed) {
    server.shutdownNow(); // probably should wait in case we have inflight connections
    log.error("Connect to feature server failed, shutting down server.");
    System.exit(-1);
  }
});
----


NOTE: You will only get a Failed later if your connection drops out. You can choose to ignore the Failure
if you already have your features and deal with it by instantiating a new client. It won't generate a failure
if the server has simply booted you off due to a timeout, only because of connection failure.

==== Static Feature Context

The static feature context is a simple and easy way to allow you to use the repository.

It allows you to determine if flags are on or off, if features exist or are set, and it allows you to do this from a
_enum_ basis. You need to have your enum implement `Feature` which just has a name function - which all enums do.

You can if you wish add a convenience function to your enums to determine if they are active and people often do.

[source,java]
----
public enum Features implements Feature {

  FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE;

  Features() {
  }

  public boolean isActive() {
    return StaticFeatureContext.getInstance().isActive(this);
  }
}
----

this means you can do something like this:

[source,java]
----
if (Features.FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE.isActive()) {
}
----

==== Local Feature Overrides

If you set a system property `feature-toggles.FEATURE_NAME` then you can override the value of what the value
is for feature flags. This is a further convenience feature and can be useful for an individual developer 
working on a new feature, where it is off for everyone else but not for them.


== Analytics

The Analytics client layer currently only supports directly exporting data to 
https://docs.featurehub.io/#_google_analytics_integration[Google Analytics]. It has the capability to add further
adapters but this is not our medium term strategy to do it this way. 

To configure it, you need three things:

- a Google analytics key - usually in the form UA-
- [optional] a CID - a customer id this is associate with this. We recommend you set on for the server
and override it if you know what you are tracking against for the individual request.
- a client implementation. We provide one for Jersey currently.

[source,java]
----
cfr.addAnalyticCollector(new GoogleAnalyticsCollector(analyticsKey, analyticsCid, new GoogleAnalyticsJerseyApiClient()));
----

When you wish to lodge an event, simply call `logAnalyticsEvent` on the featurehub repository instance. You can
simply pass the event, or you can pass the event plus some extra data, including the overridden CID and a `gaValue`
for the value field in Google Analytics.

== Using the library

This is just a repository, it needs something to fill it and currently we support Jersey. If you wish to write your
own or fill it with properties or such, you can use the artifact as is. In Maven-speak this is:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.featurehub.sdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>java-client-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.2</version>
    </dependency>
----

Alternatively we recommend version ranges:


[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.featurehub.sdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>java-client-core</artifactId>
      <version>[1.1,2)</version>
    </dependency>
----


Note that we indicate jackson as a provided dependency because most clients will have it already and we do not
wish to dictate our own. However, if you do not have a jackson dependency, please also include:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.featurehub.composites</groupId>
      <artifactId>composite-jackson</artifactId>
      <version>[1.1, 2)</version>
    </dependency>
----

== Rollout Strategies

FeatureHub at its core now supports _server side_ evaluation of complex rollout strategies, both custom ones
that are applied to individual feature values in a specific environment and shared ones across multiple environments
in an application. Exposing that level fo configurability via a UI is going to take some time to get right,
so rather than block until it is done, Milestone 1.0's goal is to expose the percentage based rollout functionality
for you to start using straight away.

Future Milestones will expose more of the functionality via the UI and will support client side evaluation of
strategies as this scales better when you have 10000+ consumers. For more details on how
experiments work with Rollout Strategies, see the https://docs.featurehub.io[core documentation].

=== Coding for Rollout strategies 
To provide this ability for the strategy engine to know how to apply the strategies, you need to provide it
information. There are five things we track specifically: user key, session key, country, device and platform and
over time will be able to provide more intelligence over, but you can attach anything you like, both individual
attributes and arrays of attributes.

Remember, as of Milestone 1.0 we only support percentage based strategies,
so only UserKey is required to support this. We do however recommend you adding in as much information as you have
so you don't have to change it in the future.

[source,java]
----
cfr.clientContext().userKey("ideally-unique-id")
  .country(StrategyAttributeCountryName.NewZealand)
  .device(StrategyAttributeDeviceName.Browser)
  .build(); 
----

The `build()` method will trigger the regeneration of a special header (`x-featurehub`). This in turn
will automatically retrigger a refresh of your events if you have already connected (unless you are using polling
client that is not set up to do this (such as the OkHttp Android client)).

To add a generic key/value pair, use `attr(key, value)`, to use an array of values there is
`attrs(key, List<String>)`. You can also `clear()`.

In all cases, you need to call `build()` to re-trigger passing of the new attributes to the server for recalculation.

By default, the _user key_ is used for percentage based calculations, and without it, you cannot participate in
percentage based Rollout Strategies ("experiments"). However, a more advanced feature does let you specify other
attributes (e.g. _company_, or _store_) that would allow you to specify your experiment on. 


== Feature Interceptors

Feature Interceptors are the ability to intercept the request for a feature. They only operate in imperative state. For
an overview check out the https://docs.featurehub.io/#_feature_interceptors[Documentation on them].

We currently support two feature interceptors:

- `io.featurehub.client.interceptor.SystemPropertyValueInterceptor` - this will read properties from system properties
and if they match the name of a key (case significant) then they will return that value. You need to have specified a 
system property `featurehub.features.allow-override=true` 
- `io.featurehub.client.interceptor.OpenTracingValueInterceptor` - this will look into the baggage of the current OpenTracing
`Span` and determine if there is a feature key override there, and if so, use it. This is kept in a separate 
package (`io.featurehub.sdk:java-client-opentracing:[1.1, 2)`) as it brings in extra dependencies. If you are using it, we
recommend bringing it into the client as well as there is a `io.featurehub.client.OpenTracingFeatureStateInjector` class
that can insert the baggage into the span on the client side. This interceptor will turn itself off unless `featurehub.opentracing-enabled=true` 
is configured in the system properties. This allows you to code it in and control it taking effect at runtime. We recommend
if you add this interceptor in, always disallow overrides for locked features. 

If you wish to test out the OpenTracing feature overrides, you can do so from the example Java application. Instructions
are there on how to do this.
