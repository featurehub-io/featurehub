= Java Client SDK for FeatureHub
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

Welcome to the Java SDK implementation for https://featurehub.io[FeatureHub.io] - Open source Feature flags management, 
A/B testing and remote configuration platform.

Below explains how you can use the FeatureHub SDK in Java for Java backend applications or Android mobile
applications.

To control the feature flags from the FeatureHub Admin console, either use our [demo](https://demo.featurehub.io) 
version for evaluation or install the app using our guide [here](http://docs.featurehub.io/#_installation)

There are 2 ways to request for feature updates via this SDK:

- **SSE (Server Sent Events) realtime updates mechanism**

In this mode, you will make a connection to the FeatureHub Edge server using an EventSource library which this SDK is based on, and any updates to any features will come through to you in near realtime, automatically updating the feature values in the repository. This is always the recommended method for backend applications, and
we have an implementation in Jersey. 

- **FeatureHub GET client (GET request updates)**

In this mode, you make a GET request, which you control how often it runs. The SDK provides no timer based
repeat functionality to keep making this request. There is an implementation using OKHttp. We have
deliberately left the timer choice to you as there are many different timer functions, including one built into
the JDK (`java.util.Timer`).

== SDK Installation

To install the SDK, choose your method of connection. The Core library will be included transitively. The
Core library uses Java Service Loaders to automatically discover what client library you have chosen, so please
ensure you include only one.

If you want to specify and deliberately configure it, you can use:

[source,java]
----
fhConfig.setEdgeService(() => new EdgeProvider...());
----

Where EdgeProvider is the name of your class that knows how to connect to the Edge and pull feature details.

- **SSE (Server Sent Events) realtime updates mechanism**

      <groupId>io.featurehub.sdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>java-client-jersey</artifactId>
      <version>[2.1,3)</version>
    </dependency>
----

If you do not already use Jersey in your code base, you should also include our runtime dependencies for Jersey
and Jackson.

----

- **FeatureHub polling client (GET request updates)**

This is recommended for Mobile as it will only request updates when you ask for them and not keep the radio on.

## Quick start

### Connecting to FeatureHub
There are 3 steps to connecting:
1) Copy FeatureHub API Key from the FeatureHub Admin Console
2) Create FeatureHub config
3) Check FeatureHub Repository readyness and request feature state

#### 1. Copy SDK API Key from the FeatureHub Admin Console
Find and copy your SDK API Key from the FeatureHub Admin Console on the Service Accounts Keys page -
you will use this in your code to configure feature updates for your environments.
It should look similar to this: `default/71ed3c04-122b-4312-9ea8-06b2b8d6ceac/fsTmCrcZZoGyl56kPHxfKAkbHrJ7xZMKO3dlBiab5IqUXjgKvqpjxYdI8zdXiJqYCpv92Jrki0jY5taE`.

There are two options - a Server Evaluated API Key and a Client Evaluated API Key. More on this https://docs.featurehub.io/#_client_and_server_api_keys[here]

Client Side evaluation is intended for use in secure environments (such as microservices) 
and is intended for rapid client side evaluation, per request for example.

Server Side evaluation is more suitable when you are using an _insecure client_. (e.g. Browser or Mobile). 
This also means you evaluate one user per client.

#### 2. Make a client:

Create an instance of `EdgeFeatureHubConfig`. You need to provide the API Key and the URL of the end-point you will be connecting to (the Edge server URL).

[source,java]
----
import io.featurehub.client.EdgeFeatureHubConfig;

String edgeUrl = "http://localhost:8085/";
String apiKey = "/default/71ed3c04-122b-4312-9ea8-06b2b8d6ceac/fsTmCrcZZoGyl56kPHxfKAkbHrJ7xZMKO3dlBiab5IqUXjgKvqpjxYdI8zdXiJqYCpv92Jrki0jY5taE";

FeatureHubConfig fhConfig = new EdgeFeatureHubConfig(edgeUrl, apiKey);
----

#### 3. Check FeatureHub Repository readyness and request feature state

Feature flag rollout strategies and user targeting are all determined by the active _user context_. If you are not intending to use rollout strategies, you can pass empty context to the SDK.

**Client Side evaluation**

What you do next depends on your framework. In many modern frameworks, you don't get to choose when
the server starts, it starts and you just have deal with it. It is recommended that you ensure that your heartbeat
or readyness check is dependent on whether the feature service is connected.

Remember client side evaluation is used for services, those processing requests (from users or via eventing systems) 
or batch processing for example. As such, they are typically wired up using Dependency Injection (DI) frameworks and
we show that approach here as it is what people are most likely to use.

As you would typically have a dependency injection system (like Spring or CDI) looking after you, you need to inject the
FeatureHubConfig you created above. Our SpringBoot, pure Jersey and Quarkus examples can be found in our 
https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-examples[featurehub-examples] repository.

.SpringBoot - wiring the FeatureHubConfig
[source,java]
----
  @Bean // using environment variables
  public FeatureHubConfig featureHubConfig() {
    String host = System.getenv("FEATUREHUB_EDGE_URL");
    String apiKey = System.getenv("FEATUREHUB_API_KEY");
    FeatureHubConfig config = new EdgeFeatureHubConfig(host, apiKey);
    config.init();

    return config;
  }
----

.Quarkus/CDI - wiring the FeatureHubConfig
[source,java]
----
/**
 * We do this at the top level because we need a Produces for the FeatureHub config as we
 * specifically want this bean and not have to delegate through, and we need the external config.
 */
@Startup
@ApplicationScoped
public class FeatureSource {
  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FeatureSource.class);

  @ConfigProperty(name = "feature-hub.url")
  String url;

  @ConfigProperty(name = "feature-hub.api-key")
  String apiKey;

  /**
   * We need a FeatureHubConfig bean available for all sundry uses, the health check and any other
   * incoming calls. So we create it at startup and seed it into the CDI Context.
   *
   * @return FeatureHubConfig - the config ready for use.
   */
  @Startup
  @Produces
  @ApplicationScoped
  public FeatureHubConfig fhConfig() {
    final EdgeFeatureHubConfig config = new EdgeFeatureHubConfig(url, apiKey);
    config.init();
    log.info("FeatureHub started");
    return config;
  }
}
----

We then recommend you consider adding FeatureHub to your heartbeat or liveness check. 

.SpringBoot - liveness
[source,java]
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/health")
public class HealthResource {
  private final FeatureHubConfig featureHubConfig;
  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HealthResource.class);

  @Inject
  public HealthResource(FeatureHubConfig featureHubConfig) {
    this.featureHubConfig = featureHubConfig;
  }

  @RequestMapping("/liveness")
  public String liveness() {
    if (featureHubConfig.getRepository().getReadyness() == Readyness.Ready) {
      return "yes";
    }

    log.warn("FeatureHub connection not yet available, reporting not live.");
    throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE);
  }
}
----

.Quarkus/CDI - liveness
[source,java]
----
@Path("/health/liveness")
public class HealthResource {
  private final FeatureHubConfig config;

  @Inject
  public HealthResource(FeatureHubConfig config) {
    this.config = config;
  }

  @GET
  public Response liveness() {
    if (config.getRepository().getReadyness() == Readyness.Ready) {
      return Response.ok().build();
    }

    return Response.status(503).build();
  }
}
----

This will prevent most services like Application Load Balancers or Kubernetes from routing traffic to your
server before it has connected to the feature service and is ready.

There are other ways to do this - for example not starting your server until you have a readyness success, 
but this is the most strongly recommended because it ensures that a system in a properly structured Java service will behave as expected.

The next thing you would normally do is to ensure that the `ClientContext` is ready and set up for downstream
systems to get a hold of and use. In Java this is normally done by using a `filter` and providing some 
kind of _request level scope_ - a Request Level injectable object. 

In our examples, we simply put the Authorization header into the UserKey of the context, allowing you to just pass the
name of the user to keep it simple.

.SpringBoot - creating and using the context
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class UserConfiguration {
  @Bean
  @Scope("request")
  ClientContext featureHubContext(FeatureHubConfig fhConfig, HttpServletRequest request) {
    ClientContext ctx = fhConfig.newContext();

    if (request.getHeader("Authorization") != null) {
      // you would always authenticate some other way, this is just an example
      ctx.userKey(request.getHeader("Authorization"));
    }

    return ctx;
  }
}

@RestController
public class HelloResource {
  private final Provider<ClientContext> ctxProvider;

  @Inject
  public HelloResource(Provider<ClientContext> ctxProvider) {
    this.ctxProvider = ctxProvider;
  }

  @RequestMapping("/")
  public String index() {
    ClientContext ctx = ctxProvider.get();
    return "Hello World " + ctx.feature("SUBMIT_COLOR_BUTTON").getString();
  }
}
----

.Quarkus/CDI - creating and using the context
[source,java]
----
  /**
   * This lets us create the ClientContext, which will always be empty, or the AuthFilter will add the user if it
   * discovers it. (This is part of the FeatureSource class from above)
   *
   * @param config - the FeatureHub Config
   * @return - a blank context usable by any resource.
   */
  @Produces
  @RequestScoped
  public ClientContext ctx(FeatureHubConfig config) {
    try {
      return config.newContext().build().get();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      log.error("Cannot create context!", e);
      throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
  }
  
/**
 * This filter checks if there is an Authorization header and if so, will add it to the user context
 * (which is mutable) allowing downstream resources to correctly calculate their features.
 *
 */
@Provider
@PreMatching
public class AuthFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {
  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AuthFilter.class);

  @Inject
  javax.inject.Provider<ClientContext> contextProvider;
  
  @Override
  public void filter(ContainerRequestContext req) {
    if (req.getHeaders().containsKey("Authorization")) {
      String user = req.getHeaderString("Authorization");

      try {
        contextProvider.get().userKey(user).build().get();
      } catch (Exception e) {
        log.error("Unable to set user key on user");
      }
    }
  }
}  
  
@Path("/")
public class HelloResource {
  private final Provider<ClientContext> contextProvider;

  @Inject
  public HelloResource(Provider<ClientContext> contextProvider) {
    this.contextProvider = contextProvider;
  }


  @GET
  @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
  public String hello() {
    return "hello world! " + contextProvider.get().feature("SUBMIT_COLOR_BUTTON").getString();
  }
}  
----

These examples show us how we can wire the FeatureHub functionality into our system in two different cases, the standard CDI
(with extensions) way that Quarkus (and to a degree Jersey) works, and the way that Spring/SpringBoot works. 

**Server side evaluation**

In the server side evaluation (e.g. an Android Mobile app), the context is created once as you evaluate one user per client.
This config is likely loaded into resources that are baked into your Mobile image and once you load them, you can progress
from there.

You should not use Server Sent Events for Mobile as they attempt to keep the radio on and will drain battery. Use the
`java-client-android` artifact and this will be automatically used for you. 

As such, it is recommended that you create your `ClientContext` as early as sensible and build it. This will trigger
a poll to the server and it will get the feature statuses and you will be ready to go. Each time you need an update,
you can simply .build() your context again and it will force a poll. 

----
ClientContext ctx = fhConfig.newContext().build().get();
----

==== Local Feature Overrides

If you set a system property `feature-toggles.FEATURE_NAME` then you can override the value of what the value
is for feature flags. This is a further convenience feature and can be useful for an individual developer 
working on a new feature, where it is off for everyone else but not for them.


== Analytics

The Analytics client layer currently only supports directly exporting data to 
https://docs.featurehub.io/#_google_analytics_integration[Google Analytics]. It has the capability to add further
adapters but this is not our medium term strategy to do it this way. 

To configure it, you need three things:

- a Google analytics key - usually in the form UA-
- [optional] a CID - a customer id this is associate with this. We recommend you set on for the server
and override it if you know what you are tracking against for the individual request.
- a client implementation. We provide one for Jersey currently.

[source,java]
----
cfr.addAnalyticCollector(new GoogleAnalyticsCollector(analyticsKey, analyticsCid, new GoogleAnalyticsJerseyApiClient()));
----

When you wish to lodge an event, simply call `logAnalyticsEvent` on the featurehub repository instance. You can
simply pass the event, or you can pass the event plus some extra data, including the overridden CID and a `gaValue`
for the value field in Google Analytics.

== Rollout Strategies

Starting from version 1.1.0 FeatureHub supports _server side_ evaluation of complex rollout strategies
that are applied to individual feature values in a specific environment. This includes support of preset rules, e.g. per **_user key_**, **_country_**, **_device type_**, **_platform type_** as well as **_percentage splits_** rules and custom rules that you can create according to your application needs.

For more details on rollout strategies, targeting rules and feature experiments see the https://docs.featurehub.io/#_rollout_strategies_and_targeting_rules[core documentation].

We are actively working on supporting client side evaluation of
strategies in the future releases as this scales better when you have 10000+ consumers.

=== Coding for Rollout strategies 
There are several preset strategies rules we track specifically: `user key`, `country`, `device` and `platform`. However, if those do not satisfy your requirements you also have an ability to attach a custom rule. Custom rules can be created as following types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `date-time`, `semantic-version`, `ip-address`

FeatureHub SDK will match your users according to those rules, so you need to provide attributes to match on in the SDK:

**Sending preset attributes:**

Provide the following attribute to support `userKey` rule:

[source,java]
----
ctx.userKey("ideally-unique-id"); 
----


to support `country` rule:

[source,java]
----
ctx.country(StrategyAttributeCountryName.NewZealand);
----

to support `device` rule:

[source,java]
----
ctx.device(StrategyAttributeDeviceName.Browser);
----

to support `platform` rule:

[source,java]
----
ctx.platform(StrategyAttributePlatformName.Android);
----

to support `semantic-version` rule:

[source,java]
----
ctx.version("1.2.0"); 
----

or if you are using multiple rules, you can combine attributes as follows:

[source,java]
----
cfr.clientContext().userKey("ideally-unique-id")
      .country(StrategyAttributeCountryName.NewZealand)
      .device(StrategyAttributeDeviceName.Browser)
      .platform(StrategyAttributePlatformName.Android)
      .version("1.2.0");  
----

If you are using *Server Evaluated API Keys* then you should always run `.build()` which will execute a background
poll. If you wish to ensure the next line of code has the upated statuses, wait for the future to complete with `.get()`

.Server Evaluated API Key - ensuring the repository is updated
[source,java]
----
  ClientContext ctx = fhConfig.newContext().userKey("user@mailinator.com").build.get();
----

You do not have to do the build().get()  (but you can) for client evaluated keys as the context is mutable and changes are immediate. 
As the context is evaluated locally, it will always be ready the very next line of code. 

**Sending custom attributes:**

To add a custom key/value pair, use `attr(key, value)`

[source,java]
----
    ctx.attr("first-language", "russian");
----

Or with array of values (only applicable to custom rules):

[source,java]
----
ctx.attrs(“languages”, Arrays.asList(“russian”, “english”, “german”));
----

You can also use `ctx.clear()` to empty your context.

Remember, for *Server Evaluated Keys* you must always call `.build()` to trigger a request to update the feature values
based on the context changes.

**Coding for percentage splits:**
For percentage rollout you are only required to provide the `userKey` or `sessionKey`.

[source,java]
----
ctx.userKey("ideally-unique-id"); 
----
or

[source,java]
----
ctx.sessionKey("session-id"); 
----

For more details on percentage splits and feature experiments see https://docs.featurehub.io/#_percentage_split_rule[Percentage Split Rule].

== Feature Interceptors

Feature Interceptors are the ability to intercept the request for a feature. They only operate in imperative state. For
an overview check out the https://docs.featurehub.io/#_feature_interceptors[Documentation on them].

We currently support two feature interceptors:

- `io.featurehub.client.interceptor.SystemPropertyValueInterceptor` - this will read properties from system properties
and if they match the name of a key (case significant) then they will return that value. You need to have specified a 
system property `featurehub.features.allow-override=true` 
- `io.featurehub.client.interceptor.OpenTracingValueInterceptor` - this will look into the baggage of the current OpenTracing
`Span` and determine if there is a feature key override there, and if so, use it. This is kept in a separate 
package (`io.featurehub.sdk:java-client-opentracing:[1.1, 2)`) as it brings in extra dependencies. If you are using it, we
recommend bringing it into the client as well as there is a `io.featurehub.client.OpenTracingFeatureStateInjector` class
that can insert the baggage into the span on the client side. This interceptor will turn itself off unless `featurehub.opentracing-enabled=true` 
is configured in the system properties. This allows you to code it in and control it taking effect at runtime. We recommend
if you add this interceptor in, always disallow overrides for locked features. 

If you wish to test out the OpenTracing feature overrides, you can do so from the example Java application. Instructions
are there on how to do this.
