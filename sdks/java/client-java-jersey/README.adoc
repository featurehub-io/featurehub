= Jersey FeatureHub Client

This is the Jersey client for talking to FeatureHub's API. It is separate from the core API because each different 
http library will implement the event sourcing and calling in a different fashion.

The version of Jersey used must be at least 2.28.

This library provides a EventSource implementation for Java using Jersey 2.x. It includes the Java Core library
as a transitive dependency, so simply including this library will make everything in Core available. 

Core uses Java's ServiceLoader capability to automatically discover the JerseyClient implementation. Please
simply follow the instructions in the https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/tree/master/sdks/java/client-java-core[Java Core library].
