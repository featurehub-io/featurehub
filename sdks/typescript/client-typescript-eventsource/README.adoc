== Description
Provides an EventSource based SSE client that listens to important events
coming from the SSEEdge from FeatureHub and hands them off to the ClientFeatureRepository
in `client-typescript-core`. 

Use this only if you are using `EventSource` - in a browser you will be, but in nodejs
you have other options, but there is an eventsource npm that mimics the browser so you
can use it in both places.

`EventSource` will auto-reconnect when the SSEEdge kicks it off and will refresh the list of
features at that time. 

=== use

----
// set up with url with sdk api
const source = new FeatureHubEventSource('http://.....'); 

// to start
source.init();

// when finished
source.close();
----

== Prerequisites 
Node @12 or higher

Follow readme instructions to build  `client-typescript-core` module - only until this is
released into npmjs, in which case it won't require it (as it will be in npmjs). 

== Installation Instructions
----
npm install &&  npm run-script compile
